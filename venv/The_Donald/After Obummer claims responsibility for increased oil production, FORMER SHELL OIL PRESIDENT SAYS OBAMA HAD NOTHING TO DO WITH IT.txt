0:::Projection is funny huh
0:::Haha what? You're flair is literally 1776. You can't imagine a treaty lasting 100 years?
0:::No, I cannot Imagine an agreement to a foreign Country. That long. 1776 wasn't an international treaty.

1:::OPEC pushing price to $150 -> massive investment in hybrid cars and extraction techniques -> US oil becomes viable again -> lot fewer IG thots taking photos from Dubai.  How exactly does Obama come into the picture again?  He was Keystone hostile?  And set aside huge swathes of Alaska?
1:::Well I mean his husband Michael IS a pro at laying down that pipe...
1:::What a loser.
1:::duh, he did this because his school was paid for by the Saudis. by keeping American oil restricted the Saudis were able to export more oil at a higher price to the US.
1:::He knows his Obamabot followers will listen and believe. 
1:::Ive seen this rumor before, where did it originate?
1:::At this point, I'm more surprised when he *doesn't* try to take credit for something Trump did.
1:::Soon to be a sad faggot convict?
1:::Holy shit he's not in office. 
1:::I propose instead of "Obama", he be referred to as "IllBombYa" or perhaps Barack "Saddam" Hussain Illbombya
1:::Remember when we found out he has at least five social security numbers?
1:::In historical reality yes but in delusional retard world no
1:::He builds big mikes erection on the daily 
1:::I voted for Obama twice.   Was a naive 24 year old. Fell for the nonsense hook line and sinker.

1:::SAD
1:::SAD!
1:::To be fair, I don't think DT is completely responsible for the energy boom either. It was obviously able to grow even under Obama era regulations because of Texas' shale oil and new technology. Trump definitely helped by loosening regulations, but I don't think it's a good precedent to set to attribute all the successes of the private sector to the federal government, regardless of who is in office. Trump just stopped restricting its growth.
1:::Yeah I honestly thought it was a shitpost too. Ignored it. Then I kept hearing about it...
1:::Most people are so uninformed or ignorant they would believe obummer was the next rape prophet.

1:::Our racist textbooks have been telling us that some racist white privileged male named Neil Armstrong was the first man to step foot on the Moon. That vile racist propaganda is untrue everyone knows it was Astronaut Barack Hussein Obama. I would also like to add that astronaut Obama's copilot was not Buzz Aldrin but in fact it was Dr. Barrack Hussein Obama, Lunar Module Pilot. And orbiting the Moon was Barrack Hussein Obama, Command Module Pilot.  But let's not forget about mission control. None of that would have been possible without the amazing leadership of Flight Director Barrack "Barry" Obama.
1:::So yes. Thanks for clearing that up. 
1:::To be fair, the fake media did an incredible job selling him. The uniparty made sure you voted for him. McCain and Romney are the same shit so there really wasn't any choice. Glad to have you here.
1:::In this case, the magnitude of success is directly related to President Trump's policies, but of course not all of the success. People build it, not the government. Here is an excerpt of a response to a hate mail I got that might explain what I mean:  *And deep down you know (I'm assuming you are intelligent) that the ideology and policies of someone like President Obama are destructive to the United States, its economy, and its core principles. And it is destructive by design, in order to fundamentally change the United States if not destroy it altogether, as that is ultimately what is required by an ideology completely foreign to and at odds with the US Constitution and the very basis of the founding of this country.*  *And for all of President Obama's efforts to "fundamentally change" the United States, a phrase he himself used multiple times, the ingenuity of the American system was able to get around his policies time and again and still find successes. That is why the energy sector was able to make gains even while the Obama Administration did everything in its power to stop them.*  *And that is why, with a new administration and a president that, instead of wanting to undermine the United States wants to floor the gas pedal on what the United States can do, is seeing so much success in all industries at an unprecedented rate. And the majority of what the Trump Administration is doing is merely removing all of the roadblocks that Obama and previous administrations put into place. Because someone like President Trump realizes that, not only is government not the solution to peoples' problems, but it is generally the cause or the exacerbation of problems itself.*  *So yes, the success is due to Trump policies. The policy of "get out of the way" of our economic engine is incredibly successful. It isn't that difficult to do, as Trump himself has said. All it takes is not being chained to some dogmatic ideology and just doing what makes sense. And if President Trump feels the need to remind people of the success his policies are having, then more power to him.*  *It's not as if the corporate media, who have a financially driven reason to oppose him at all costs, are going to give him any credit for it.*

2:::Serious question Obama vs Carter? 
2:::Because he's a narcissistic, not smart, jackass.  I used to defend Obummer online. So, seems I'm not so smart either. But in my defense, I got my learner on, and figured it out. And we are all prey to the black eagle of propaganda.  Propaganda. Big Mike, drilling us every day. 
2:::The only thing Barry Soetoro can claim is destroying and destabilizing this Country for 8 years.   #THAT IS HIS LEGACY
2:::So.....then we're saying the former shell oil president is a racist, and just plain didn't like the (half) African-American "man" in the White House?  Is that what we're saying?  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  /sarc\_off
2:::Am I banned lol  Edit:no
2:::"man"?
2:::‚ÄúObama is a sad little man.‚Äù  Just like his husband.
2:::LOL at "man".
2:::Almost feel bad for someone who had that much illegitimate support for 8 years .... and still accomplished nothing of value.  And now to watch someone he hates in President Trump help the country recover so quickly and absolutely from what Obama tore down...must be heartbreaking for him.  Good!
2:::I think it‚Äôs most funny how he predicting it failing.  If this truly was his economy, wouldn‚Äôt he have said it‚Äôs going to be booming soon?
2:::AHAHA!
2:::He also discovered that planets orbit the sun in the 1600's, it wasn't Galileo.
2:::Wokest take in thread
2:::Obama is Shia, he hates SA almost as much as he hates America 
2:::He is jealous of potus. Jealous that he earned his wealth, jealous of his high iq, jealous of his success, jealous he has a gorgeous brilliant real woman for a wife, and jealous that he has our love and admiration. Obama can go to hell for what he has done!
2:::Yeah and he is clearly upping the drug use... sweating, stuttering and flailing around.
2:::Well he did force Americans to have to pay fee's if they didn't have Obama insurance so he did worse than doing nothing.  Also he raised people's perceived reliance on government to bail them out which is psychologically damaging for our country.
2:::He now chooses to live out his life as a simple cheese farmer.
2:::Well he did it for 8 blaming Bush so. 
2:::Fun fact, Barry went on to marry his Crack Dealer from college!

2:::He‚Äôs a weak rino and no legit friend of potus. I‚Äôd rather have john James but we shall see.
2:::He did basically fuck the lower class's support for most welfare policies. That's just how badly he fucked that up.   He couldn't even give out free money correctly.  A usable failure of a system is always worse than no system. 
2:::Ugh. I had somehow forgotten about all of that endless whining he did about Bush. 
2:::Aloha snackbar!
2:::Gross.
2:::Beleive me folks, it's yuuuuuge.
2:::Its because hes an anti-christ figure.
2:::He knows he isnt the deep state will protect and doj/trumps team doesnt have the guts to do anything

3:::Literally tries to claim ownership of anything and everything Trump has accomplished. After a stagnant economy for two years before he left office and another two years of solid growth under Trump he thinks he can still pull this shit? Hilarious. 
3:::Republican says something; MSM: ‚ÄúExpert claps back after politician gets it wrong/lies‚Äù  Obama says something (clearly wrong); MSM: *crickets*
3:::Well he didn't go full commie and try to socialize oil like Venezuela- you know he would have liked to. He deserves big credit for that restraint. 
3:::Is there a statute of limitations for how long his crap can go on?  Is he going to be doing this for the next 30 years?

3:::You mean Obunga  followed by screaming noises

3:::The last Democrat that did something good for us oil production, was Jimmy Carter. As he helped deregulate domestic oil prices. Which lead to a surge in exploration and production. 
3:::Holy shit I thought it was just a funny bs meme. He actually had the nerves to claim that? What an absolutely narcissistic lying POS Obama is. 
3:::Fuck. This is so absurd it's reached meme material.

3:::Please elaborate.  
3:::Does the man's husband have a name?
3:::That works too!  ü§£ü§£
3:::Reagan cared about the People intensely. But he just was not able to do what President Trump can do. He didn't have the training.  I actually believe Carter cared too. But he was way, way over his head. The one thing Obama taught me was that Jimmy Carter was not actually a bad guy, just an incompetent one. Obama was an actual bad guy.
3:::That is absolutely disgusting.
4:::When the heat death of the universe finally happens. Obama will be there to say he did it.   Think I speak for all Americans that Obama hanging about is getting very boring. He isn't even good for the left anymore.   He is toxic as fuck. Pretty much like Hillary. People just don't like him anymore.  
4:::IN other words "Once a LIAR always a LIAR".. As the old saying goes..  Obummer is a legend in his own mind.......
4:::Obama did everything in his power to stop oil production. 
4:::It is vicariously embarassing watching Obama take credit for shit that he clearly didnt do, and in some cases, said was impossible, and watch the leftist masses eat it up.  I mean I'm not even mad, I'm straight up depressed for them.
4:::Can this guy shut up already! Go back to giving  reach-arounds to Michael.
4:::Obama = sad
4:::That‚Äôs right. Screw Obama, he‚Äôs trying to take credit for shit he didn‚Äôt help build 
4:::Just think of the gains Obama would of created if he had only stayed in office one term.  
4:::Nobody cares about you anymore Barry. Put an egg in your shoe and beat it.
4:::Dude flat out said he liked $4 gas ‚õΩÔ∏è 
4:::He‚Äôs mad that Trump will become a major historical figure and he will fade into nothing. In 20 years people will still be talking about Trump and with racism becoming almost nonexistent nobody will really care about the term ‚Äúfirst black president‚Äù which is all Obama has going for him. 
4:::‚ÄúIt was in fact I who married Melania!‚Äù
4:::Obama also takes credit for sliced bread
4:::Hey 0bama...YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT !!!!
4:::His legacy is already destroyed. Might as well milk money off the dimbeciles.
4:::At least Trump brags about things he actually has done or tried to do.  Anyone that knows anything is aware Obama actively held back oil & gas. If he didn't the economy would have recovered even quicker. Oil & gas was the main factor driving the economy despite Obama. 
4:::Weird. How do you simultaneously claim to increase oil production while claiming to fight climate change by reducing oil consumption?
4:::It‚Äôs funny because he‚Äôs basically admitting that his policies were so shit that it had to take nearly 2 years after his presidency to start recovering and booming. What a pathetic individual Obama is, he knows that a greater president has preceded.
4:::Obama would suck his own dick daily if he were flexible enough.
4:::I thought people were joking when they said Obama claimed credit
4:::#Hahahahahahahahahaha
4:::**Ouch! This statement from Shell's ex-CEO is going to leave a mark.**
4:::# FOLKS
4:::I'm fucking dying laughing from this comment chain ahahaha
4:::> He did literally the EXACT OPPOSITE of this  Thankfully, he was really really bad at his job.  
4:::It would be one thing if he also took credit for the downturn we had.  But it is painfully obviously shills at this point.   >Economy goes up  "OBAMA IS A GENIUS AND THIS HAS NOTHING TO OD WITH LE DRUMPH!!!"  > Economy goes down  "OMG CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT AN IDIOT OUR PRESIDENT IS?  LITERALLY RUINING OUR COUNTRY!!!!!"
4:::Agreed. Play to his people and spew more lies. The liberals eat that shit up. Barry is once again deceiving the low information group. 
4:::Barack Obama couldn't build a lincoln log cabin with a detailed blueprint.
5:::Why does this socialist community organiser hang around like a bad smell?    If only he had organised his Chicago community to produce less corpses... 
5:::Ya know, I'm getting REALLY sick of this narcissistic faggot.  He spent 8 years with the lips of the lugenpresse surgically grafted to his sphincter, yet can't stand it that he is old news.  Now that President Trump is accomplishing great things for actual Americans, he is trying to take credit for the achievements of his betters .  Of course, he has almost no achievements of his own, so he has to do this stupid, annoying shit.
5:::Sorry, 0bama. You didn't build that.
5:::All the idiots who thought this guy Obama was some sort of saint. Saint Bozo, maybe.
5:::Is there anything Obama won't take credit for?  Pathetic
5:::Will Obama also take credit for signing the emancipation proclamation? Betcha he would.
5:::Obuma seems mad that he has been forgotten and his mess fixed so quickly.
5:::My gosh, what an attention whore.
5:::In ficen credible. How many people hear this crap and actually believe it? That's the problem, right? That people believe stuff like this?
5:::I just watched his video while speaking at Rice University. Complete and utter arrogance and ignorance, it‚Äôs hard to watch. 
5:::everything Obama did or touched went to total shit   &#x200B;  Cash for Clunkers  Iran Deal  Paris Accord   Obamacare...........     anything missing cause I sure there is  &#x200B;  sorry fucking excuse for a leader/president, why cant we flush this sorry ass turd already. 
5:::Why doesn't he just go away like Bush did
5:::You would think T-Rex would opine on this subject.
5:::That idiot is desperate for a legacy lol.  Nope.  Your legacy is broken ass healthcare reform that helped NOBODY but your campaign contributors in the healthcare industry.  Piece of fucking shit.
5:::O bummer you didn‚Äôt build that
5:::Wait, Barry really claimed credit for oil production?  I thought that was just a joke making fun of him taking credit for shit.                       But no, the hyper-narcissist really said it.  Astonishing.
5:::Wait the guy who wanted to do away with oil production is now claiming he is responsible for increased production? This guy is beyond delusional
5:::I briefed Obama's DOE for a period of time. He did absolutely nothing positive for the energy industry, and in fact sought to damage it in every way possible while subsidizing cost ineffective alternative energy. I could go on for days about how shity the Obama administration was for the energy sector.
5:::Obama is the most arrogant, snobbish, elitist bad hombre to ever be President.
5:::He is pivoting so fast, soon he will claim himself to be a republican. 
5:::If if if if if if if if if if if if if 
5:::Did you just assume his gender?

5:::I say, I think it has something to do with wealthy white slave owners pitting their slaves against each other in some physical competition or some such.
5:::bunch of grown men kneeling next to each other, kinda like a gay porno.
5:::To be fair we've all been conditioned to think this way. Anything shitty was Clinton's fault. Anything good was Bush's. Democrats did the same when Obama got into office (albeit, taking it to the extreme).  The reality is that from Bush Sr through Obama, they were all pretty much crap when it came to the economy. Obama was specifically trying to destroy our economy since he's a leftist activist and getting socialism into America takes a destructive approach. But Bush Sr, Clinton, and W Bush were all globalist puppets (whores for the dollar). Same outcome, different motivations. All of the good during their administrations was due to America just being so badass, we find ways to get around their terrible policies and win anyways.  Now we have a president who openly roots for our economy and actively tries to get any roadblock out of the way of it. It's going to be incredible what the end result of that is. You ain't seen nothing yet. We haven't even got to the part where food is cheap yet. Can you say less than 2 dollars a gallon milk? You will. Just wait.
6:::It‚Äôs been almost 2 years and he‚Äôs still taking responsibility? Lol what an ass. 
6:::MUH LEGACY!!!
6:::Funny, I don‚Äôt see Obama taking a lot of credit taking for his fabulous health care plans. 
6:::What the hell is up with obama saying this is his doing, like when he took credit for the booming economy?
6:::Didn't Obama block the new pipeline which led to a ton of protests about the environment and the protesters trashed the environment? 
6:::Using this same logic, he is also responsible for the murders in Chicago of black youths as these also increase and correlate during his presidency.
6:::Wow I can‚Äôt wait until the media covers this wall to wall üôÑ
6:::BTFObama
6:::won't see this on r/popular or r/all 
6:::Michelle bought him some tendies and he knocked them out of her hands.
6:::Obama can try and bullshit his way to getting credit for economic shit, but there is no way in hell anyone with a working brain stem can suggest he *helped* oil production. It's about as believable as Al Gore inventing the internet.
6:::It's mind-boggling that he could even *begin* to claim he had anything to do with it. I guess you can make the argument that "if I hadn't been holding everything back with all my strength, it wouldn't have shot up so quickly after trump slapped my hand away," but that was nowhere near intentional.
6:::That turd told me fossil fuels were bad for 8 years now hes claiming credit for them so trump doesnt get credit for lower prices? Wtf 
6:::Who cares? You weren't bitching about it when Obama was buying oil from those same countries. You damn sure weren't bitching about it when Obama was using ISIS to oust Assad in order to build a pipeline from Qatar to Turkey.
6:::Please explain how Trump is going down in flames.

7:::Why does he have to take credit for something that he was actively impeding? All the cucks cheering for their messiah in the background too.

Hates that HOPE and CHANGE came from Donald Trump in 2 years and not from his 8 loooooong years of doing nothing but turning himself into a billionaire with multiple houses. He had a super majority in both houses one time, did shit with it but Obamacare which everyone hates. Did nothing but ESPN brackets and JAY Z hot dog parties. A total failure soy boy. Sad pathetic life.   His supporters? Even worse sad pathetic people to continue to follow a fraud after 8 years of no American accomplishments for the American people and American businesses.   Sad people. Barry is lashing out at his own inner hatred of what he became by taking Soros Door #6 in 2007.

11:::‚ÄúBut look over there at the statistics‚Äù   Hey Barry. Production increased in spite of you. Not because of you. 
11:::He has no legacy, so he's trying to steal credit from others people's accomplishments. 
11:::What‚Äôs this sports league you‚Äôre referencing?
11:::Barry dual wields.
11:::And visiting Pedo island.....
12:::It‚Äôs Rubio!
12:::You mean Herpes Hillary?
13:::I'm gonna love watching CNN cover this, while they flail to back up Obama's role in increasing domestic oil production while also declaring that fossil fuels are evil and wait for it...racist.
13:::Sad that he has no accomplishments of his own that he has to claim President Trump's.
13:::Yeah, people that ask those questions don't get in the same room as him.
14:::Let's just put it this way. The German president of the international company I work for that sells primarily to the oil and gas industry said in a state of the company speech that he really hoped we all voted for Trump because that would probably be the best thing to get us back on course.
14:::No one likes 0bama. He promised his supporters so many things and never delivered, he was just another Bush. The MSM talks highly of him but most his supporters are gone. 0bama is a nobody now.
14:::"Sad little man"*  *man not included 
14:::Don't assume zits gender, you racist Nazi bigot.
14:::No kidding. Obama was using the 2008 recession as an excuse for the poor economy until the end of his presidency, and now has the audacity to take credit for Trump's success after his administration did everything in their power to thwart his nomination?   I'm normally able to maintain a certain level of dignified respect for former presidents regardless their term and politics, but at this point Obama and his wife can go fuck themselves. 
15:::He campaigned to reeduce oil production. 
15:::Getting wrecked by the companies you put the screws on, eh?
15:::[deleted]
15:::If it wasn't for the fact that these people are actively working against our country it'd be fascinating to watch.
16:::> Shut the fuck up.  Former Shell President
16:::Barry is the saddest little man in the history of the Presidency. He tried his best to keep the country in the shitter both socially and economically yet he celebrates himself as having accomplished great strides in saving the US economy which in reality was only the natural rise of the economy from the rock bottom that Bush and 0bama were responsible for. The economy would have rebounded much faster if all the while 0bama hadn't saddled the economy and the American people with cockamamie schemes like TARP Bailouts (Bush but made worse under 0bama's direction), The useless debt bombs the likes of the ARRA and Cash for Clunkers for examlle, the fiasco that became Obamacare, Establishing energy policy and blocking pipelines that screwed over Americans and raised energy prices, etc. Damn near every economic, policy, and social action he took seemed to be custom designed to knock the legs out from under the struggling economy and the American people. All that failure and massive piling of debt and the economy still managed to bring itself up from the Great Recession because that was literally the only direction it could go, that is the only reason 0bama created any jobs or growth at all, the sheer force of the American economy not to completely fail and implode. Then Trump is inaugurated and starts making policy and immediately as if a massive weight of economic, and social sabotage had been lifted off the American economy it immediately takes off and begins to soar and does so even better than if you just took away the economic sabotage that was 0bama policy and let it naturally recover. The economy jumps into high gear almost overnight, job creation comes roaring back, wages begin going up for the first time in decades, the economy grows at an unprecedented rate, unemployment hits a 50-year low, etc. Yeah 0bama we do owe it all to you...for getting out of office and not doing everything you possibly could to sabotage our economy and fuck over every single man, woman, and child in The United States. Let me be the first to thank 0bama for improving our economy greatly...by getting his worthless ass out off office and stop hobbling our economy with every shitty decision and policy he could possibly implement. Good riddance to bad rubbish!
16:::Obama knows his fans are dumb and msm wont correct him.
16:::Hell yeah, what a scum bag teacher.
17:::The "man" is desperate for attention
17:::Even if this was true (it's not), we are now going to see liberals suddenly supporting and praising domestic oil production. Speaking of delusional. 
17:::He says what the new world order tells him to say.
17:::Because he was too busy dicking bimbos.
18:::I think it's a bunch of felons concussing each other for your entertainment between excessive commercials.
19:::You forgot: ‚ÄúBreaking News‚Äù
19:::#Hey now.... Listen here! Chew Soap!
19:::Cock Holster? Weird... I don't see his asscheeks flapping? You must be referring to his knob polisher pede! Simple mistake! 
20:::Anyone remember when prices went down after the 2008 election then went back up after a year or so? Did he take credit for something that happened when he was President-elect and blame Bush when the prices went back up?
21:::Except he's not even black.  He's like 6% black, 44% Arab, and 50% cracka.  And that's assuming his fucked up geneology we've been given is even correct.
22:::Obama needed to be slapped down and notch or two.
23:::[deleted]
23:::2008: "Now i-i-i-i might just be a little black boy from Illinois but I have a dream!"  *crowd cheers*  &#x200B;  then he was president for 8 years, that's basically what happened.
24:::Obuma would have signed it. $100 trillion american tax dollars stolen and given away to 3rd world dicktasters who then give hallf of it back to their favorite US democrat politician. Easiest scam ever.
24:::Cuz Hillary sticking around wasn‚Äôt bad enough? 
24:::Clinton wisely stayed low key grifter most of the time.
25:::One time, just one damn time I'd like for someone to ask him "what exactly did you do to achieve this" when he makes these claims.
26:::Its just fucking sad
26:::Let's dispel once and for all this fiction that Obama doesn't know he is going to jail.
27:::See, Barack? YOU didn't build that.
27:::Yeah, I heard him say that stuff word for word. I know he has said some stupid shit, but this one was a doozy.
27:::It‚Äôs true. The Clintons always display and surround themselves with such class and decorum.   https://www.gao.gov/new.items/d02360.pdf 
29:::If Barry had a mustache, it would be called a dick broom
29:::>I disagree with Obama  >"You racist!"  Wow, flashback to 2008.
29:::I remember I was in 8th grade and I told my dyke sjw English teacher I didn‚Äôt like Obama and she called me a racist in front of the whole class.
30:::When he couldn't get he economy going, he blamed it on bush. He thinks that all things good that are happening are his doing by the same logic.
30:::My friends and I ripped her to shreds everyday for the rest of the year after that lol
31:::OKIE DOKE --------
31:::Oh finally there'll be peace in Israel
33:::Obama is a piece of shit who i hell bent on destroying the US energy and mineral independence  Blows my mind that almost noone knows about this shit  https://capitalresearch.org/article/two-gold-into-dross/  https://vimeo.com/146418671   >For scientific support, the Assessment uses numerous studies by anti-mine activists. EPA quietly commissioned Peer Reviews of seven studies authored by anti-Pebble activists, presumably in hopes of bolstering their credibility. No studies supportive of the Pebble Project received any such treatment, including the Pebble Partnership‚Äôs $150 million contribution of the most comprehensive and relevant environmental data set available on the region. When EPA quietly had seven of those studies peer reviewed, EPA‚Äôs own peer reviewers found them to be biased and unreliable, but EPA used them anyway.  >EPA manipulated the peer review of the Assessment itself in a way designed to minimize criticism of the Assessment. EPA violated its own standards when, during the first peer review, it unduly restricted the schedule, shielded the peer reviewers from public comments, and then held a closed-door meeting with the peer review panel. During the second peer review, EPA shut out the public entirely, completely violating its own standards for transparency.  >For the first peer review, EPA provided a very narrow charge to the Peer Reviewers for their review of the initial watershed assessment draft in 2012, and limited public access to the Peer Review panel to three-minute per-person verbal presentations. EPA met with Peer Reviewers in private, refused to release their full reports on the watershed assessment document and subsequently published a significantly watered down summary report.  >Notwithstanding these limitations, the Peer Reviewers gave voice to some very serious criticisms of the watershed assessment, some of which are presented in this submission. For the second draft of the watershed assessment in 2013, EPA provided its charge to Peer Reviewers in private. In fact, no public access to the Peer Reviewers was permitted whatsoever, and EPA recently reported it may publish the final draft of the watershed assessment before any Peer Review input is made public. While EPA‚Äôs management of the Peer Review process in 2012 fell well short of the agency‚Äôs own guidelines for such processes, the 2013 Peer Review made an open mockery of them.   MUH science!!
34:::That would be racist! How dare you bigot! Check your fucking privlege!! I can't imagine how hard Obama must have it being kept down and out of positions of power and influence his whole life by white fucking males (except for me! Actually I'm trans black.) I'm sure given the opportunity to give the people something to hope for he could make a difference! FUCKING BLUMPGH! IT WAS HER TURN!!! 
42:::This is like if Chip Kelly tried to claim credit for the Eagles winning the Super Bowl.
43:::You still haven't.  Obama's "presidency" was a LARP that everyone went along with.
43:::Honestly, if this is true, it's kind of hilarious
45:::Clearly the Former Shell Oil President is a Racist Bigot!!!!!   Also I built that says increasingly irrelevant former president. 
52:::It's the Democrat way.
55:::I don't recall Clinton coming out as a sour puss like this when Bush was in.
58:::He literally says the opposite of whatever he has ever done. 
67:::Never forget that if President Trump had followed through with the Obama-sanctioned Paris Climate Accord, this headline would not exist because oil production would be in the toilet--and they would be blaming Trump about it.
76:::#If if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if
76:::He's becoming increasing unhinged lately.  Of course the media will never call him out on his baseless claims.  
83:::In addition to stealing furnishings from the White House, Clinton's staff removed all the W keys from keyboards to stick it to him.
84:::he‚Äôs not delusional. he knows what he‚Äôs doing 
85:::I guess you cooould make an oblique argument that his predatory attitude towards domestic oil production forced the industry to improve?  ... maybe?
109:::If barry is running his cock holster he's lying 100% of the time no exceptions 
141:::FAKE NEWS!  In fact, he was GIVING road head FOR crack.
142:::Obama 2016: "Trump will destroy the economy if he gets elected. The market will crash and unemployment will soar. 3% GDP is a madman's pipedream."  Obama 2018: "Isn't this booming economy great? What about those low oil prices? Kinda good don't you say? Well just wait till we get 3% GDP all thanks to me."  If a man is wrong about one thing and then claims credit for what he was wrong about. You know you're dealing with a real liberal.
187:::I've never seen former presidents act so immature and unprofessional.  Other than Clinton.  All other presidents honorably went home and kept to themselves unless needed.  Only the Demorats Clinton and Obama have stuck around, like dog shit on a shoe.
238:::Obama really is a delusional piece of shit.
289:::"You know your presidency was truly awful when you have to take credit for the current work of your current successor." - Ryan Fournier
317:::CNN: ‚ÄúHow Obama smoking crack in the back of a limo getting roadhead from another guy is a good thing‚Äù
350:::When I saw earlier today that he had said this, I thought it was just a shitpost. I couldn't believe a former president of the United States could really be this petty and pathetic. It's actually embarrassing. He's literally running around taking credit for the good policies of the Trump Administration, which is bad enough, and there was at least enough believability (if you're ignorant) in his claim that at least part of the good economy was his (it's not). But after all he did to thwart any and all growth in the energy sector for 8 years, to claim ownership of its new success is blatantly false. And he KNOWS it.  Very sad!
357:::He literally tried everything in his power to stop pipelines and kill fracking.  He can't be serious? 
605:::Obama is a sad little man.
