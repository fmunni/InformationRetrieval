-4:::We gained two seats, but retired gop swamp senators flake and corker and retired several long time dem senators.  Gop started -43 in house before elections started  with all the gop congress swamp retiring or not re running. Election Day gop was +3 in senate, -26 in house. Post election shenanigans, it ended +2 senate, -40 in house. Which at that is better than most presidents midterms. So yes gop swamp gone in house and senate, and better midterm than the last 30 or so presidents except for bush. Despite the odds stacked against them in the house   So yea. That’s unprecedented

0:::Why do you think “like Romney in 2012” is specifically called out in here? https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails//fileid/1120/251
1:::Does anyone remember rinsed penis, john Mcshitstain, or lying Ryan ? Its going to be a much different game this time around.
1:::I would put Romney in charge of fixing the water in Flint.
1:::But I thought Orange man hated wamen?
1:::She needs to keep Uncle Mitt in check. 
1:::*Claps!*
1:::**MY 2020 RE-ELECT**
1:::So mysoginistic! /s
1:::Lol yesterday Drudge said he wouldn't even run.  Fake news!
1:::Blatant sexist. 
1:::She actually seems to be America First.  I wish we could permanently ban the cucks, RINOs, neocons, and never Drumpfers from anything related to politics.  We'll just have to get more America First people in office and in the system.
1:::And let's not pretend like election results have anything to do with this.  Michael Steele is a Never Trumper now, but he had historic gains in the 2010 midterms and got beat when he ran for reelection less than a month later.
1:::I agree. The GOP let them steal the House without saying a peep.
1:::Trump saying normal things make liberal heads explode, but Trump tweeting shitposts like this must give them brain aneurisms.
1:::We won Florida, but yes on Arizona though.
1:::McSally dropped the ball or wasn't trying to win that seat but vote block Dr. Ward out of it.
1:::this times 1000. Shes a snake.
1:::And stole 250 million
1:::We won Florida, no thanks to her, from what I've heard. 
1:::you know that most of them talk dirtier than the POTUS in their personal lives...hypocrites
1:::MI as well. Detroit gave no fucks and raped us deep blue.
1:::LOL nice account stats, looks like 85% of the deported.
1:::Unless he indelibly touched you on your hippocampus, YOU ARE FAKE NEWS!
1:::LOL you're not a child if you're still in a vagina. You're a fetus. And there's no you either, that's just A fetus. 
2:::I can't believe we have such a sexist as a president! I bet he only chose her again so he can pay her 56 cent for every dollar a man would make.
2:::Total sexist REEE
2:::Well....fuck.
2:::Romney’s neice. Maybe she can keep the ULTRA CUCK in line. 
2:::What did Ronna do with the election fraud?
2:::She also let the Democrats get away with massive voter fraud.
2:::#FRONT-STABBER
2:::Then he will be destroyed.  The Boss only offers 2 options.
2:::KeK 
2:::I agree, the GOP is cucked.
2:::If they are answering tone, I wonder if that is what they actually mean or if that is a euphemism for something else they don't want to say to the reporter. 
2:::Yup and the GOP didn't do shit about it.
2:::Wait reince was actually short for reinhold? 
2:::and NJ, and WI (Walker)
2:::NV wasn't stolen. Let's not act like we lost every single race because of fraud. The early voting number for Dems was massive in NV and signaled a tough day for Heller even before we saw how badly he got crushed on election day. Nevada was blue in 2012 and 2016 as well. It's not as though Heller was the greatest Republican either. Moderates like him are usually the ones who get punished most during so called "wave" midterms. Swing voters/independents see them the same as people who don't vote moderately, while the hardcore base see them as being too moderate. The majority of Republicans who got wiped out in the 2018 election were moderates. Meanwhile the more conservative candidates like DeSantis and Kemp both won.  
2:::> Election Day gop was +3 in senate, -26 in house **Post election shenanigans**, it ended +2 senate, -40 in house.  You just said it yourself.  "Post election shenanigans".  wtf?  This shit has to be challenged. 
2:::you can think whatever narrative you want. but at least 20 of those seats were legit lost (ya know, the 20-23 GOP house districts that HILLARY won in 2016?). we were prepared to deal with -26 lost seats on election night remember? it was the other -14 seats that were bullshit. i'm actually being very generous saying 20 of those seats were stolen.
2:::I only had 1 McFlurry, but the Playhouse is indelible in muh hippocampus. He threw me in the ball pit. I don't remember what my Happy Meal toy was, and I don't remember who took me to the drive through.  I now need two front doors though, because the food made my ass too fat.  Just ask my beach friends.  My cellulite was protruding through my bikini bottom. Very disrespectful.
3:::What a sexist asshole 
3:::She’s a fucking Romney
3:::For all the GOP's massive accomplishments, for all our message's successes and inherent truths, for all of our righteous policies, for all of the history of the Republican party that has proven it a champion of equal rights, for all the historic fundraising levels, the GOP still lost the midterms to a bunch of cheating Leftist scumbags. 
3:::Yes, this.
3:::Uh, yeah. That's what happens in the midterms. It's a proven, long-term historical pattern.   Despite the presidential-party disadvantage, the Republicans still increased their lead in the Senate. Not bad.
3:::Yeah but REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
4:::Help me Ronna!
4:::She sure dropped the ball in Florida and Arizona. 
4:::I disagree. McDaniel has been a disgrace. Record fundraising, yet many candidates like Brat barely received any help and lost by a slim margin. Even worse, the Dems probably cheated and the GOP has the head stuck up the ass. Unbelievable. McDaniel and her entire team needs to be fired. Wouldn't surprise me if Trump lost in 2020 due to Dems cheating and the GOP swamp not funding the wall.
4:::KAG! 2020
4:::Hmm liquated asset tax-free but don't get a divorce, looks like both sides win....
5:::I wonder if the GOP did anything about the Damnocraps stealing California for the House.
5:::Shills are here...trying to act like Trumpers.Deport them!
5:::You mean Reinhold Richard "Reince" Priebus?
5:::Nazi confirmed.
5:::# GIVE Congress the 1 FINGER SALUTE  Let GEOTUS know he doesn't need Wall Money from Congress!  The Real Wall is being hidden, and $11 Billion to quickly build it is being diverted by WIFIA at EPA.  **Send in the A-TEAM: Mr. T, MULVANY, MADDIS, MOOCH, and MNUCHIN,** to DRAIN THAT SWAMP because We got The REAL WALL to BUILD CENTIPEDES  [https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/)
5:::I think he and his wife are still together though. She called off the divorce IIRC?
6:::Worst mysogynist ever.

6:::That’s always a plus. 
6:::I can't support Mayor McCheese until The Hamburgler is brought to justice. Let Constable BigMac do his job!
6:::I forgot why the mooch only lasted 11 days but I remember that they were a great 11 days. I hope the mooch returns someday soon. 
6:::Oh, cool, then I endorse the comment that went ZOOM, right over me.  ;)
6:::And yet the left has no problem ripping innocent  terrified children from their mother’s vagina
7:::[removed]
7:::It was a compliment
8:::#MEME WAR 2 INCOMING #T_D TRUMPS ALL THEIR HATE #TRUMP/PENCE 2020 #KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
8:::For those that heard otherwise, **TRUMP 2020 CONFIRMED!**
8:::Romney has to know he got deep state fucked in 2012. 
8:::Grimace touched me inappropriately 30 years ago!
10:::"Do you think children should be ripped, screaming and terrified, from their innocent mother's arms?"  &#x200B;  Give me a fucking break.
11:::There he goes again, being sexist...oh, wait.
12:::That's pretty fucking cool, I didn't even know that.  Stick it to the man!
13:::thank you!  and shame on all of you who blame her for the failure in the house. half of those 40 lost seats were stolen. other half were lost legitimately because a bunch of triggered white soccer moms who voted for trump in 2016 ended up voting dem or staying home because they don't like the POTUS' "tone (read: jeb bush)" and tweets.  no matter what she tried it wouldn't have worked on those soccer moms. soccer mom pedes need to redpill those butthurt soccer moms because they sure af won't turn on rush limbaugh and listen to him.
13:::I'm sad to admit that I don't trust Ronna because of her relation to Mittens.  I shouldn't feel that way, but I just can't help myself.  Mittens Romneycare is *everything* that is wrong with our politics. Slippery cunt with NO principals other that "get Mitt elected".
13:::got fucked?  he played along.  Remember debate #2.  Romney sold the fuck out, like he always has.
14:::But muh patreeeeeeeearchy!!!!
15:::**2020 HERE WE COME!**
17:::Exactly. What comments were made about Arizona.  Florida is easy.   But AZ CA and MT and probably NV we’re all stolen
19:::A Romney.  Maybe Mittens will cooperate, but I doubt it.
19:::Mac for district comptroller 13!
22:::Agree. This member of the Romney clan doesn't do much compared to her Democrat counterpart. However, Trump will no doubt have more than his share of trouble with Mitt without firing one of his close relatives. 
23:::I like how she stopped using "Romney" in her name
24:::[The Mooch makes GEOTUS look like Mr. Rogers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx1zx8M3XQg)
30:::I love Mooch, the perfect hatchet man comes in cleans via resignation etc in the WH and falls on his sword for Gen Kelly to come in.     PS his reputation might take a beating, but he took the role on as his divorce was getting messy and being confirmed allowed him to liquated his asset tax-free.
36:::Mooch follows me on twitter, so I will not diss him.
45:::Legit thought that said Ronald McDonald at first glance lol
67:::Eh, gains in the senate had way more to do with the favorable map for the year and Trump's rallying.  If anything she let the house theft happen without any foresight of, action during or after.  Fundraising means nothing if you don't do much with it.
70:::And then it turned out that Sloppy Steve did in fact suck his own cock. Thank you, Mooch!!
191:::She is doing great after Rinsed Penis turned out to be a dirty leaker.  Remember when the Mooch fired him? Good times.
