1:::I think Trump might be in ruble. I mean trouble.
1:::[removed]

1:::This is a huge, well-timed, extremely well-cited drop from Buzzfeed News (shout out to Anthony Cormier and their impressive investigative journalism wing) that adds to the evidence pile of Putin-Trump coordination. Going to be a rough weekend for President TRE45ON in Argentina I take it.

1:::I guess those "walls are closing in" reports were actually true then.  
1:::Absolutely unreal. The rank corruption just oozes off this man.    I for one am glad Cohen decided to turn state witness and  (hopefully) actually mean it.   Trump is going to jail along with Manafort, Stone, Corsi, and Don Jr. Are we all prepared for when Trump screams coup? 
1:::This is one of the biggest conflicts of interest in US political history. Trump spent the whole election criticizing Hillary's national security problems while he was directly involved in business with Vladimir Putin.

1:::" The revelation that representatives of the Trump Organization planned to forge direct financial links with the leader of a hostile nation at the height of the campaign raises fresh questions about President Trump's relationship with the Kremlin. The plan never went anywhere because the tower deal ultimately fizzled, and it is not clear whether Trump knew of the intention to give away the penthouse. But Cohen said in court documents that he regularly briefed Trump and his family on the Moscow negotiations. "

It's coming. The Senate is making space for the Mueller report. This is how they probe.

1:::How are these people so fucking stupid? How did they not think these things would be discovered?   Or did they simply not care?
1:::>Sater told BuzzFeed News today that he and Cohen thought giving the Trump Tower’s most luxurious apartment, a $50 million penthouse, to Putin would entice other wealthy buyers to purchase their own. “In Russia, the oligarchs would bend over backwards to live in the same building as Vladimir Putin,” Sater told BuzzFeed News. “My idea was to give a $50 million penthouse to Putin and charge $250 million more for the rest of the units. All the oligarchs would line up to live in the same building as Putin.” A second source confirmed the plan.  Pump the brakes. This actually sounds like a solid, creative business strategy, not something that Trump would come up with.

1:::i thought i had some sort of a realistic, distant, jaded perspective on this whole situation. it's not that i didn't think it could get any more confounding than it already was, but i thought i'd come to terms with the fact that it was just going to keep getting worse, more absurd, more surreal, more idiotic - and i'd taken heed, i'd adjusted my discourse tactics accordingly.  this - this is tangibly, unimaginably offensive. this is blatantly fucking ridiculous. there is no possible way anybody could ever realistically spin this as pro-'american.' this is pure, unadulterated arrogance. i am in utter awe that they either thought they'd be able to get away with this or that they didn't care if they didn't, and i didn't think that was possible anymore

1:::This fucker is going down. Lock him up.
1:::My favorite part about all this is him and his idiot family could have gone on with their criminal empire and they would just be annoying. He had to run for president now they are all under a microscope by the press, the government, and the three letter agencies. He tried to get into football and they didn't want him and I don't think he was well liked in billionaire's club either. He was a shyster con man who thought he could be a big man with deals like this and get away with it.   He has pulled a lot of shit in the last two years and likely a lot to get there too and it will catch up with him. I am hoping that this is just the beginning of a very bad end for him and his family for trying to shape a country into their sad image of a narrcicistic, crooked, old businessman who acts like a bully but is a pussy. Maybe this is the universe finally saying fuck you to him and his family.
1:::I guarantee Trump is reading about this today and gets scared shitless as he remembered submitting sworn testimony that he didn't have any business dealings, or discussions thereof, with Russia or Vladimir Putin in particular.
1:::What a week. What a week. Tomorrow is an f5 kind of Friday.
1:::WTF penthouse in Moscow costs $50 million? It's not like midtown Manhattan.  Is the whole damn thing made of gold?
1:::That's it.  Put his fat ass in prison.  There it is.
1:::My head just exploded
1:::This will end quite horribly for Trump. This makes Vlad look bad. Makes him look buyable (which we all likely assumed to some degree... but for real estate? In Russia?). Vlad will start being seen as less than the pedestal RT and many Russian citizens place him on. I can only imagine how much Donald will pay for this. And I don’t think Vlad will find it worthy justice no matter what the American due process decides to do with him.
1:::Well that sure is nice!
1:::Huge amount of brigading on this one, the folks over at the sub which shall not be named must be really worried. 
1:::I really love how Buzzfeed has managed to make an official investigative journalism team made up of highly reputable journalists from across the industry. Several award winners too. And their reporting on the mental health and asylum industry has been spectacular, with how they almost won the Pulitzer Prize from those pieces.   It's also nice that they're finally using a separate URL for their news division.

1:::Just two distant acquaintances trading 50 mil apartments for free. Nothing to see here.
1:::What the fuck is going on this week? 
1::: So lets say for arguments sake we’ll give Trump the benefit of the doubt and he didnt know. That means someone below him was planning to give away a $50 million penthouse without talking to the boss. That means hes weak. I would never go around my boss for anything money related, let alone something with that big of price tag. Hea not bigly strong man after all.
1:::Please deny Trump is corrupt now, with not only the Russia scandal, but also favours from Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Turkey.   It's literally impossible

1:::>Trump had personally signed the letter of intent to move forward on the Trump Tower Moscow plan on Oct. 28, 2015, the day of the third Republican presidential debate.  And there's a receipt!
1:::Well, I mean, "NO NOTHING" is a double negative and implies there actually IS something, so maybe he (accidentally) told a tiny kernel of truth there?
1:::As these new details continue to come out about how Trump has been deeply involved with Russia for years while claiming he wasn't deeply involved with them, we really need the media to clearly point out his repeated lying. Just today he made these statements about seeking to build Trump Tower Moscow during 2016 after repeatedly saying during the campaign that his business had nothing to do with Russia. He cannot be allowed to say this without fact-checking and pointing out all of the times he lied during the campaign.  Usually the media resists calling him a liar when he says false things -- they give him the benefit of the doubt and say they can't know if he is lying because they don't know if he knows the truth or is just saying what he believes is true. But when we look backwards and compare his past statements to new information about what he was doing in the past, that's when we can definitively point out all of his lying.
1:::From today: [Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein Delivers Remarks at the American Conference Institute's 35th International Conference on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/deputy-attorney-general-rod-j-rosenstein-delivers-remarks-american-conference-institute-0)  >When we follow the rule of law, it does not always yield the outcome we prefer.  In fact, one indicator that we are following the law is when we respect a result that we do not agree with.  We respect it because it is required by an objective analysis of the facts and a rational application of the rules.   >The rule of law is not simply about words written on paper.  The culture of a society and the character of the people who enforce the law determine whether the rule of law endures.   >One of the ways that we uphold the rule of law is to fight bribery and corruption. Until a few decades ago, paying bribes was viewed as a necessary part of doing business abroad.  Some American companies were unapologetic about corrupt payments.   Honestly the tl;dr of Rosenstein's speech is: We will hold people accountable if they break the law, including this bribery law. He backs it up with a couple of Trump quotes about upholding the rule of law, which is amusing.
1:::2 spooky 4 coincidence
1:::Where have Kellyanne Conway, Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort and a number of Russians owned condos? Someone remind me.
1:::This is probably why the Trump-Putin meeting was canceled, the WH got word of this story.
1:::Felix Sater who that quote is from, was interviewed by mueller a long time ago if I remember correctly. 
1:::Trump would have had to okay this, right?
1:::Also  sounds a lot like inflating the price of Mar-a-Lago membership and then turning around and awarding an ambassadorship to member Lana Marks.   
1:::That is actually not a bad idea from a business standpoint. Unethical as hell and probably illegal but that's one way to sell apartments and Russians are probably the only people who would want to buy Trump apartments anyone right now.

1:::Yea, I watched that press thing he did and my jaw was on the floor. He admitted it, again, live on tv. He is beyond fucked.
1:::Just like he blurted out confessions of obstruction of justice several times. He's an orange glazed idiot. 
1:::LMAO his excuse is literally that his odds weren't that great. Like no fam, you're running just like everyone else. It doesn't matter what your damn chances are.  It would be like if one shitty sports team was playing a really good team and the coach of the shitty team was betting on the game but they end up winning and his excuse is "We weren't supposed to win tho...."  LOL what an idiot.
1:::>why should I lose lots of opportunities?  Because they violate the emoluments clause?  I am certain trump has never read the constitution.
1:::His reaction on election night makes sense now. No one looked happy. Melania admitted to crying. They really didn't want to win. Or maybe they just didn't think it would work and went forward as if the would lose. I'm thinking they just didn't think it would work. But then the real killer is America really was that fucking racist to do this and people are still going to act like they were forced in a way by Russia. 
1:::Lmfao  That's incredible, he's even dumber than I thought 
1:::Only that those particular "business opportunities" had everything to do with turning that "good chance he wouldn't have won" into being the next President of the United States, and then having to lie and cover-up  that relationship for the next consecutive 678 days (and counting) all the while being entirely compromised and conflicted in every decision he made.
1:::I like how even in a brief moment of clarity, he can’t even utter the word “lost” in reference to himself. 
1:::>lots of opportunities  It's so fucked up how he sees the seat of the president. It's just a way to make himself richer.
1:::Oh yeah, Trump's plan the whole time was to go clean if he somehow won the election.  Yep.  Believe him.

But the other leverage Russia enjoyed over Trump for at least 15 years is indisputable — in fact, his family has admitted to it multiple times. After a series of financial reversals and his brazen abuse of bankruptcy laws, Trump found it impossible to borrow from American banks and grew heavily reliant on unconventional sources of capital.

The identity of those individuals remains unknown.   Well that’s intriguing and integral to all this. Kind of a buried lede: some of Cohen’s business partners were willing participants in the GRU hacking scheme. This could very well help tie up the entire Russian plot.

1:::In all of this, I *still* can't believe how hard Putin played Trump.  From Putin's perspective - it was a win win. Either Trump wins and Putin has his puppet, or Trump loses and Putin succeeded in dumbing down our elections and discrediting Hillary.  I can only hope future administrations can bring the hurt down on Putin they way he deserves. Sanctions so hard that Putin can't even win relection *with* cheating.
1:::Which begs the question what is Putin's end game here?
1:::So he also sucks at colluding? 
1:::Maybe his bone spurs will come out of remission after decades.
1:::Those symptoms sound pretty bad... Better not give him any job with any level of responsibility, authority or consequences.   Oh wait 
1:::Affluenza
1:::But he is the healthiest individual ever to seek the presidency!
1:::I want the other world leaders to bully him so badly.
1:::He might not come back 
1:::Oh he bailed on Argentine already.  
1:::All while Trump is in the air heading to teh G20 summit  Air Force One must be dead tense silence on one side and the press corp loud and questioning everyone on the other side

1:::>Are we all prepared for when Trump screams coup?  Didn't he start doing that like 1½ years ago?
1:::What we should be worried about is when his ammo sexual, white nationalist cult screams it's a coup and try to take things into their own hands. Obviously they don't win that fight, but a lot of people will needlessly die if it happens (which, I doubt it will)
1:::One of?  Nah, we've crossed that line. We are now officially in unprecedented territory.

1:::The moment they realize he is a liability they will impeach his ass. Hopefully Pence is implicates too and gasp, pelosi will be president. They have a few weeks to make Paul Ryan president and retain their dignity and the presidency.   I believe Paul Ryan will be president by January 3. A republican congress and senate will impeach both trump and pence. They will both be pardoned and the republicans will pat themselves on the back for waiting for Muellers findings. Mueller will release his findings soon so the republicans have the chance to not make Nancy pelosi president.

1:::The absolute monumental size of their brazenness.  It boggles the mind.

1:::Jesus, this was the stupidest line I heard during the election. I heard it from educated people I (used to) respect, too.

1:::Also Putin is a monster.
1:::Holy shit I forgot about that table of empty folders. Fuck trump supporters 
1:::How is this even real life?
1:::And yet it doesn't matter one bit until someone actually DOES something about it. If Bill Clinton could be impeached for a lie about a BJ and Trump has lied every day since DAY 1, he should have been impeached a long time ago. The problem is not even if he's done anything wrong it's getting the people who can hold him accountable off their asses.
1:::And for those wanting confirmation, here's the transcript, on whitehouse.gov - https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-marine-one-departure-27/ -  > I was running my business while I was campaigning. There was a good chance that I wouldn’t have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business. And why should I lose lots of opportunities?
1:::I had to rewind what he said to make sure I wasn't hallucinating. The evidence at his trial is going to consist of only his tweets and interview segments.

1:::Give him a chance.  He's new at being accountable.
1:::When was this?
1:::*Warning* : I’m not politically savvy. I really don’t know much at all. But I’ve had this question on my mind for a while. I’ve asked people that have far superior knowledge on the topic than I, but still didn’t get a response that made sense. Maybe you can help.   Literally since day 1 (technically, before he actually won office) I read or hear about terrible shit that he has done. Seriously it feels like every single day. One doesn’t need to be politically savvy to understand he is as crooked as they get, and really doing disgusting things daily. So my question is... why is nothing happening? I look back on when I was a younger man and the witch-hunt after Clinton for getting some succ in the Oval Office and wonder “why the fuck is nothing happening? He’s destroying the country and doing irreparable damage.   The only answer I’ve got was “because the republicans are letting it happen”  Well that just doesn’t make sense to me. There has to be someone that can do something.   Is this it? Has mueller been building and building and biding his time? I’m so damn confused. 
1:::Meanwhile his supporters saying "oh successful businessman can't be president? You expect every one of 20 candidates to quit their jobs to run for President, when only one will win???"  You mean, do we expect candidates to follow the law? Yes we do. 
1:::He's not officially an idiot until there are consequences. 
1:::Pete Rose is STILL banned from the Baseball Hall of Fame.   The Baseball Hall of Fame has a higher adherence to rules and regulations than the FUCKING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

1:::Donald Trump Jr looked pretty happy. But then again he could be just as clueless as Trump
1:::He would have better off losing.  Use his popularity to springboard more business ventures all while bitching about how bad the us is under Clinton. 
1:::The Trump presidency is the *Springtime for Hitler* of the 21st century. 
1:::Anything we know, he knew months ago. 
1:::We just say Barney 
1:::He's only gone and nozzed up the mainframe couplet, nozzed it right up!
1:::Barney ruble, trouble
1:::wait a minute, you arent poppinkream...
1:::Ya, this is every bit as evil and organized and treasonous as we all knew.    It’s just so easy to forget after the Tsunami of crime this fucker has unleashed in the meantime.  This is a conspiracy of nation changing dimensions and significance.
1:::Trump and the people around him had to of been pretty confident that there was no plausible way that the American public could ever be so stupid, so gullible and so completely devoid of critical thought to actually elect him. Even with Russian wind in the sails. I'm guessing he ran to build his brand knowing he'd never be elected and that Russia got behind him knowing he was in their pocket and that he could throw this country into chaos leading up to the election... And then it became clear that enough of the US population was dense enough to actually elect him and Putin realized he could have a patzi in the White House. At which point he put everything they had behind it and it worked out. That November night must have been the best night of Putin's life. 
1:::I like it when the writers tie up the plots neatly
1:::The Pences are extra creepy when clapping in unison.
1:::Ivanka definitely knows what's up.  Clearly they keep Trump Jr in the dark seeing how happy he is.  This family operates on a need to know basis and Trump Jr may actually believe a lot of his father's lies but Ivanka knows   Jr is such an idiot but they're all crooks
1:::i like how halfway through pence gives a little head tilt like....'cmon why u so sad'
1:::The contrast between Trump's reaction and Don Jr's shit-eating grin + fist pump is hilarious.
1:::I saw this argued in another thread but it really makes sense: in Trump's world, you don't go to prison for white collar crimes. His entire history supports this belief. At worst, you get some bad press, maybe a fine, but never a conviction and never jail. There are always people you can pay off, or have your charity make a donation to a prosecutor's campaign. So he had no frame of reference for the Mueller investigation. I think he still does not understand how fucked he is because he himself is not aware of all the laws he broke. 
1:::winning the presidency is turning out to be the worst thing for trump  his criminal empire is finally crumbling
1:::I still question the full legitimacy of the election.   Russians got into voter registries in multiple states   Purge enough liberals and you can throw the election 
1:::for now, but what happens when we fix our shit? Cause it's gonna happen, may take 10yrs, but it's gonna happen. So what does Russia, Putin, and his rich buddies do when that America comes back? 
1:::To sow chaos in the west by supporting far-right candidates that he could blackmail. Trump's policies of catering to the ultra wealthy and his rhetoric are destroying the US from within.   Russia only has one aircraft carrier which leaks and gets tugged around. They coudln't beat us militarily. Putin used trolls instead to manipulate the conservative voter into electing the host of *The Apprentice.*
1:::Weakening NATO, lifting sanctions, drilling the fuck out of the Arctic. 
1:::He wanted Ukraine
1:::Keep NATO from expanding east and lifting sanctions.
1:::Repeal of the Magnitsky Act 
1:::He wanted to maintain eye contact with beta-trump while tapping his wife in a free penthouse, manafort-stone-style cuckery
1:::I'm of the opinion that Putin doesn't really have an endgame. Hillary losing to \[insert Republican here\] was already the preferable outcome, and every day Trump spends in the White House is another day the US becomes less of a rival on the geopolitical front. All Putin is doing now is milking the situation for all it's worth, because his plans have already succeeded beyond reasonable expectations.
1:::Any chaos in NATO countries strengthens Russia's spot on the world stage.
1:::Chaos in the United States. The weakening of American Hegemony. 
1::: Putins End game: To prepare the world for the Russian dominance in trade and geopolitics.  The main ingredient to Russian dominance is climate change. Climate change is good for Russia. It will open up trade routes in the north to rival the trade that goes through the panama canal.- dont forget China's new foray into geo-politics with their presence in central America- this flew under the radar.   It will also allow them to access huge stores of Oil and gas that is currently unattainable with the permafrost that covers it- the only way that they can get a jump on that is blocked from the embargo- EXXON is the only company with the capabilities to access said oil as of right now.   Ukraine is a major point of trade and  maritime warfare they need the peninsula -   The wealth from this venture is Generational - and any one wanting just a small piece will make billions upon billions. Putin is in it for the Trillions.   In order to do this, the embargos need to be lifted. Any and all policies that  slow down climate change needs to stop- Allow for expansion through Trade/Policies. That includes eliminating NATO.  If they control the mid-east, or lessen our control then they will have access and trade to existing major oil companies.   Next will be the African countries, they hold a lot of the rare medals that are used for our cell phones, computers and such.  Weaken the USA to the world and make the USA trade or political agreements seem weak due to the upheaval of American policies and Politics.   All of the steps are in the open, its just hard to grasp it.

I also don't think the House has the will to impeach right now. I mean, there are 40 seats being held by people who blame Trump for losing the election. I'm sure they can get a majority in the House, but Paul Ryan won't make that move right now.  I don't think he is getting impeached this year. Mueller's report and Schiff's subpoena pen with a brokered Speaker election is what I see. It's not going to be Pelosi, but it's not going to be McCarthy either.

Edit: I meant assuming Trump goes full term and Pence is not made President.
1:::Will it be like this forever?
1:::Seriously. At the beginning of this they gave the, "let the investigation play out" excuse for not impeaching. At this point I see no acceptable reason for leaving him in power while he continues to undermine our American democracy. I get that they want to ram their agenda through, but it's time to do the right thing if they want a country left to feed off of.

1:::Yep. These "admissions" he keeps making are all just barely vaguely worded enough that I think he could weasel his way out of them. Good thing Mueller probably isn't relying only on Trump's motor mouth.
1:::No, he’s an idiot regardless. Just because other Republicans are too corrupt to care and Republican voters are even bigger idiots, that doesn’t change the fact that he’s a monumentally stupid individual.
1:::He doesn't need advice.  He's got the best instincts.  The best brain.  He's a stable genius!
1:::Yeah but it's being all pushed on Trump. Watch after he's gone people try to act like the republican party wasn't the problem, it was him. He made the party take these stances since he was their leader. And the voters will say Russia persuaded them they didn't believe this things, I just wanted to feel safe.

1:::Buzzfeed is very careful to say it is unclear whether Trump knew about the proposed 'gift' of the FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR penthouse to Vladimir Putin.  No one is going to believe that. I understand Buzzfeed couldn't confirm that aspect, but there is ZERO chance in hell that Trump wasn't aware.  A 50 mil penthouse. "Maybe Putin will become my new BFF at Miss Universe Moscow?"  Horse shit. Trump was in this up to his shoulders. He is a control freak and the mere idea of simply giving away the best penthouse in Moscow? Donald knew every detail. Has, in fact, said he prides himself on knowing every detail of every project.  This may be the most damning thing to come from 48 hours of incredibly damaging news.

1:::Yep. No need to touch the votes if you can purge enough voters from the rolls.   That, and the psychographics with CA, and a few tens of thousands of votes later, there we are. 
1:::.. Keep buying GOP members.
1:::They get fucked by Team America.
1:::They're running on borrowed time. Oil prices are down, sanctions are crippling them and their youth is fighting back. Putin's projection as a strongman is as fake as Trump's. He's not thinking about the 10 year plan, he's focused on keeping power now.
1:::> Putin used trolls instead to manipulate the conservative voter into electing the host of The Apprentice  We got punked, dammit.
1:::And a penthouse 
1:::Yep, he wanted Ukraine and to end the Magnitsky act 
1:::And then he’d test the waters in the Baltic states. 
1:::This is certainly one of the more plausible theories. 
1:::Aye.  He won the short game.  Things could go very south for Putin in 2020 with dems in control..
1:::Dude we don't want him here, send him to Bolivia, we have enough shit with Marito as president
1:::The winds of shit are blowin Randy.
1:::Merry Christmas! Shitter's full!
1:::And 6ix 9ine
1:::Can he be un-Presidented already?
1:::Bravo
1:::lmfao
1:::Oh bother...
1:::That's next level. Good shit
1:::It isn’t going to happen with a single (R) senator. You get the clutching of pearls from the usual suspects. Nothing more. 
1:::Today makes Watergate look like a parking ticket. 
1:::Especially on his many, many, tremendous buildings
1:::Except on those NDAs
1:::...Have you ever, by chance, heard the name Jeffrey Epstein before?
1:::Trump does have connections to Jefferey Epstein. He flew a few times on the underage Party Plane, and has been accused by at least one woman of raping her, with Epstein, when she was 13.  Funny how the Pizzagate crowd ignores that though.  https://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/04/jeffrey-epstein-trump-lawsuit-sex-trafficking-237983
1:::I mean, trump hung out with Epstein. Even insisted his daughter model for his agency / with him.  I'd bet money that Putin has video of trump banging teenagers at a hotel in Moscow.
1:::Ahem- https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-labor-secretary-alexander-acosta-went-easy-on-pedophile-predator-who-ensnared-victim-at-mar-a-lago-report
1:::Did someone say ‘pedophile ring’?   [Unfortunately we just might see more on that subject. ](https://twitter.com/miamiherald/status/1067778749276536832?s=21) 
1:::Ron Howard: "It was."
1:::This might sound weird but given that there are pedophile rings, if one of them is attached to this mess, at least it’s one that will be found out and broken up.   Oh god, there probably is, isn’t there? At the very least, they’re using underage (and other) sex slaves, which are euphemistically called “prostitutes” by enablers and the ignorant.  This will get very, very ugly. 
1:::Nothing says GOP like getting caught with underage male prostitutes. 
1:::I’d like to introduce you to Jeffrey Epstein and the Labor Secretary Acosta....
1:::You know who else has a shitty k to d? 300 Russian Mercs against US special forces in Syria. Heyo.
1:::Lmfao, if they ever make OfficeSpace 2 I hope they include a scene like this.  "Yeeeeah, how's it going Peter, looks like you didn't show up to your performance review. I think we need to uhh... have a chat."  "Oh yeah, that thing. I canceled it. Didn't you see the meeting cancelation notice in Outlook?"
1:::You try telling your boss that you don't want to go to a meeting with them. 
1:::By knowing you're the one in power.  "mom I'm not goin to school today"  "oh yes you fuckin are"  This is where we're at. 
1:::>How do you reject a person deciding not to go to a meeting?  By being fucking Putin.
1:::If someone's your bitch they heel when you call.  Trump is a pathetic, moronic, and disgusting minion of Putin. 
1:::We just started the show. Mueller finished it, rewatched it and is now telling us cryptic shit like “I’m not gonna ruin it but that next episode is crazy”. 
1:::One of the things I can't believe people forget about when it comes to how much of a piece of shit he is.  A self proclaimed "billionaire" took 7 fucking dollars from cancer kids to pay for his kid's BSA fee.
1:::...[or the guy who demanded a cut of the $100 that indie bands paid to have their music played at Tower Records listening stations in Trump Tower](https://mobile.twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/994327183278657536?lang=en). It totally makes sense that he wouldn't care about, let alone be aware of, a $50m penthouse being given away.  
1:::Since you put it that way, [here’s the hairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act). As an aside Donald attorney [Roy Cohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cohn) for many years could help you you fill in any bald spots.
1:::Roger Stone is another one that ain't falling on a sword and going to jail for nobody. He is going to tell all he knows the moment he is asked. Shame that there's no honor amongst thieves. 
1:::>	"If Cohen is such a bum, why did you hire him, have him on your payroll for 12 years, and have him do so much of your dirty work, like paying off a stripper?" a reporter asked Trump on the South Lawn of the White House.  >	“Because a long time ago he did me a favor. A long time ago he did me a favor," Trump said. The president said Trump did not elaborate on the "favor" before embarking on a 10-hour flight to Argentina for the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires.  Haha what? He can’t not blurt out dodgy shit.
1:::>"If Cohen is such a bum, why did you hire him, have him on your payroll for 12 years, and have him do so much of your dirty work, like paying off a stripper?" a reporter asked Trump on the South Lawn of the White House.  We need more reporters to ask questions like this. 
1:::I consult my doc if it lasts LESS than four hours now 
1:::I get the feeling that now that the country has effectively gone 2 years without a president, the presidency won't really be seen as an important role in America. I REALLY hope I'm wrong, tho. 
1:::Don't be so naive as to believe that things will ever be the same after this. Even in a best case scenario, our democratic norms and our reputation and standing in the world are irreversible damaged. 
1:::No, I lived through the Watergate Scandal. All felt lost then too. Hang in their. When his base starts to crack the Republicans will all of a sudden get spines. 
1:::It seems that almost daily you see some new development and people spouting "He's so done!" And yet soon it's 2019, he's still the president. It's bit like the whole wikileaks stuff, trickle down the outrage bit by bit and it becomes new normal. Nowadays everybody takes it at face value that they're probably spying on everything.   
1:::>If Cohen is such a bum, why did you hire him, have him on your payroll for 12 years, and have him do so much of your dirty work like paying off (inaudible)?  What a bunch of cowards
1:::Holy forking shirt balls
1:::Shockingly accurate 
1:::Strip mall, maybe
1:::>Don Blurt: Mall President  Thats gold!
1:::He has the best words, and hires the best people!   Every day is opposite day for Trump.
1:::Nah, we remember that they could've impeached Trump's ass the first 100 days with all the crimes going on but the GOP was cool with it. Which is why we voted them out of the House.
1:::That’s one of my favorite lines from the movie 
1:::PoppinKream uses a different format for citations.
1:::I'd recognize that look anywhere.
1:::Doesn't necessarily mean he knows all the inner workings. He may have known some things but didn't think his father wanted to lose.   Mob families learn to keep their stories straight even within the blood. 
1:::*"The wheels of justice grind slowly, but exceedingly fine"*
1:::There's no problem down there, believe me
1:::It's inconceivable that a guy who used his slush fund charity to pay $7 for his son's Boy Scout registration fee was somehow unaware of giving a $50 million penthouse to Putin.
1:::As I've said in a few threads, Trump is an extreme micromanager. He would have an ear on the ground and tinker with things as small as individual menu items at the Trump Tower Grill. He heard Tower Records were getting $100 per local band who wanted to have their CD carried in the store and tried to get a cut of it when they were his tenant.   He absolutely knew about this, knew about the Trump Tower meeting, knew about the hacked wikileaks emails, etc. It's his MO down to a science.
1:::This was my first thought as well.  trump is one of the greediest human beings ever to live.  Zero chance anyone would be authorized to give a $50M freebie to Putin or anyone else.  
1:::> I sincerely hope I'm wrong, mind.  I hope so too. Americans are tired of Politicians getting away with committing crimes that the rest of us would have to serve. 
1:::I'm sure the political elites are willing to toss Trump to an angry mob if it means staying off a full-blown revolution for a decade or two.
1:::There are a whole bunch of politicians who've landed in jail in recent years. Blagojevich, Weiner, DeLay, Cunningham, Hastert, Grimm, just off the top of my head, I'm sure there are more. Chris Collins and Duncan Hunter Jr are under indictment.  Trump going to jail isn't actually that far-fetched.
1:::>US politicians don't have the stomach for jailing their own  probably because if they can do it to one of their own then it can happen to them too.
1:::To be fair, he was an obviously unqualified half-demented old dolt who said every offensive thing he could think of to not get elected. And yet America said “yeah, give us some of that!”
1:::Fuck YeAHHH!
1:::And sanctions removed. 
1:::I was told there would be piss tapes
1:::And to embarrass and ruin the United States
1:::Trump’s on a shit rope, Randy. He tries and he tries to get a firm grip but the rope is greased with shit and he just slides further down the rope. 
1:::I wanna unpresident him so hard 
1:::Trump said of Epstein in 2002: "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."  
1:::I don't know why people don't realise that so much more went on on that man's property than he was convicted for.
1:::Please, go on...  Ninja edit: https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article221897990.html
1:::The Pizzagate crowd doesn't ignore it at all.   They just keep threatening to kill the accuser, her family, and the law firm representing her until she goes to ground again.
1:::Also, current Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta was the one that got Epstein a mind-bogglingly good deal and not as a defense attorney, he was a fucking US Attorney.  > Facing a 53-page federal indictment, Epstein could have ended up in federal prison for the rest of his life. >  > But on the morning of the breakfast meeting, a deal was struck — an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s crimes and the number of people involved. >  > Not only would Epstein serve just 13 months in the county jail, but the deal — called a non-prosecution agreement — essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein’s sex crimes, according to a Miami Herald examination of thousands of emails, court documents and FBI records. >  > The pact required Epstein to plead guilty to two prostitution charges in state court. Epstein and four of his accomplices named in the agreement received immunity from all federal criminal charges. But even more unusual, the deal included wording that granted immunity to “any potential co-conspirators’’ who were also involved in Epstein’s crimes. These accomplices or participants were not identified in the agreement, leaving it open to interpretation whether it possibly referred to other influential people who were having sex with underage girls at Epstein’s various homes or on his plane.  https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html
1:::They don't ignore that, it's "fake news" because they don't like the facts.  But Bill and Hillary are guilty of everything they've ever been accused of.
1:::If it involves an actual victim that might be trying to get justice the pizzagate crowd isn't interested.
1:::Ivanka
1:::Holy crap, I'm not sure what bothers me more, that the Epstein case was so shady (never really looked into it before), or the fact that I just read the entirety of a journalistic story on Twitter.
1:::Can't be worse than the ratio those boko harem fucks had a few years ago when a ton of them invaded Mali, so the French sent just 300 soldiers and routed their entire force, can it?
1:::Better dead than red
1:::"Hey, remember that videotape?"
1:::And here's the answer, folks.
1:::I think the piss tapes are like the 9th or 10th most worrisome things in trumps mind right now.  
1:::In communist Russia, meetings reject you!
1:::And by controlling Trump's puppet strings. If Trump ends up going it's because Putin has the power to force the president to meet against their will... 
1:::except it's more like Mueller going "oh you're gonna love this when you get to it. no, I'm not telling you a damn thing, other than he's involved in some way."
1:::"What do you mean by that?"   *"no comment."*
1:::It's okay though because that money was never going to go to cancer kids anyway.
1:::He already had his chances to do that and lied repeatedly. Stone going to jail but he isn't afraid to take down anyone he can with him. No honor amongst thieves. 
1:::I can see at least one silver lining to their lack of honour - let the circular firing squad begin!!!
1:::We just accept that yours is permanent, Mr. Mueller. 
1:::Interestingly, I have the opposite notion. People are going "HOLY shit we really fucked this one up guys. And the president can apparently fuck a lot of other shit up we hadn't previously realized. Let's never do this again, k?".  At least that's how I'm feeling.   Preemptive Disclaimer edit: I didn't vote for President Shitforbrains. But I was woefully uniformed and didn't vote at all. So that makes me part of the problem anyway. 
1:::If anything, Trump has shown how important of a position president is. We’ve lost any soft power we had in the world. Our budget is completely dicked. And it’s possible we’ll see another recession before this is over. He’s demonstrated how much damage someone incompetent can do
1:::i get the feeling that going forward there will be a whole host of minimum requirements and other new standards for future presidents, like minimum years of political experience, minimum political office held, mandatory psychological evaluations, mandatory investigation of tax records and business divestments, anti-nepotism laws, stricter oversight of security clearances, stricter oversight of white house business relationships, stricter oversight of white house communications, greater importance and criticism of general conduct, stronger protections for journalists who are doing their jobs in good faith, stronger punishments for journalists who are **not** doing their jobs in good faith. and of course, greater outside control of executive orders, my god, the troubles that can be caused with the swish of a pen.  seriously, i could go on and on.
1:::He's also created a template for the next dude to come along who is just as evil, but not so stupid.
1:::Day 679 of Lord Trump. I accidentally clicked on a bookmark of "wtf happened today". Still going. Sigh.
1:::Fork. Fork.  Why can't I say fork?!
1:::I like how you got gold instead of the person who made the original comment.
1:::Yeah, but people somehow forgot that very early on McConnell said he was going to obstruct everything Obama did. Because a lot of people didn't seem to grasp this was why congress was such a shit show when republicans got the majority. And they also seemed to forget all the shit gwb did, and started saying be wasn't that bad when you think back on it. So I feel like this will definitely be overwritten. 
1:::"It will be nice working with proper villains again!"
1:::*statement valid only for the 99%, terms and conditions apply
1:::What a fucking journey this administration has been. 
1:::I'm going to have to defer to your expertise on this matter, Dongsquad.
1:::Seems more like just petty greed. I bet that if he hadn't become aware of those things directly (accidentally), he would have never once made an effort to find out about them.    Trump seems like the guy to ignore a mountain of critical things that causes an entire casino to go bankrupt, then notice a small problem on his lunch menu and try to roll heads over it. 
1:::I hope a ton of people end up in prison for a very long time.    I've always been skeptical of the idea that many corporate and political leaders are ruthless narcissists who care about no one but themselves.  But the revelations of the Panama papers, the collusion between Trump and Putin, the involvement of people like Eric Prince and members of Trump's cabinet, the failure of the business community to speak out about Trump, and the assistance of this whole shot shoes by members of the GOP make me believe that the rot at the top is not a rare exception.
1:::And in many states you can have your life ruined and serve serious prison time for having an ounce of weed.
1:::Americans will never revolt unless their actual survival is threatened
1:::Porque no los tres
1:::after what's come out so far, i 100% believe the pee tape exists, steele was confident in it, and now we have to at least give him the benefit of the doubt, he's been right about everything else
1:::The penthouse was part of the down payment to get them back. 
1:::*drunkenly stumbles down the porch steps, never spilling a drop*
1:::And didn't Epstein's rolodex have like 9 different phone numbers for Trump in it?
1:::"Wife swapping is boring, let's daughter swap.  Have you seen Ivanka?  She's hot AF" \~DJT probably 
1:::My favourite is when you point out Donald Trump is very likely a child rapist, someone would chime in with "Bill Clinton yadda yadda" like it's a rebuttal or something. I think people just really don't want to think rich and powerful people use their power to do shit we know people will do if they can get away with it... And they can and so. 
1:::As was disclosed today, the guv in charge of prosecuting him and giving him what a defense attorney said was "the deal of a lifetime", was about to be nominated for Attorney General.   *Wonder why Trump would nominate the guy that gave his buddy the best deal a prosecutor ever offered to replace Sessions?*
1:::I tried to find some info on this, do you have any links, or a quick summary?
1:::Pretty sure boko harem had a horrifyingly high k/D vs civilians though depressingly. 
1:::Sad upvote
1:::At least you woke up. There's plenty of people who don't vote and still, somehow, have no idea what is going on. 
1:::Let's hope.
1:::For somebody incompetent, he's sure done a lot of targeted damage that benefits specific individuals and harms the rest.   It's not incompetence; it's malicious intent.
1:::I felt like I was taking fucking crazy pills when the narrative of GWB as a lovable idiot who tried his best started showing up around reddit.   Like the fuck? Gifted the presidential election by Sr.'s supreme court and his brother in Florida, started his own war, finished his dad's, oversaw the largest economic recession since the great depression, sunk NOLA, among a fucking laundry list of others. Not to mention who he surrounded himself with. To me, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney are on par with Henry Kissinger for being fucking evil bastards.  So I'm with you. I've sort of lost faith in our electorate having a memory span longer than a news cycle.
1:::*void if populace angered beyond repair
1:::That feels *extremely* accurate. 
1:::We keep forgetting and then learning again, a rule as old as money itself.   Money is the root of all evil. It may be a neccessary evil, but any system that allows for very rich very poor will always find the very rich corrupted by greed. It is, unfortunately, human nature.
1:::Apparently, last night Randy Credico went on a twitter tirade where he tweeted at Trump that Roger Stone had confided in him things about Trump’s perversion and economic crimes going back 37 years that make him believe everything in the dossier is true. Then he deleted his account.   I don’t know wtf to make of that because today he was telling reporters that it was just a joke and was intended as payback at Stone for dragging him through all this mess, but I’m kinda surprised we haven’t heard much about it today. 
1:::You know how I know the pee tape exists? Because it existing is the only way the rumor even starts. It's so specific and abnormal that nobody else would even conceive of this act occurring.  I hate Donald Trump. But if someone said "hey, I have a guy that can get some hookers over to this hotel room he once stayed at and they'll pee on the bed where him and Melania slept", I wouldn't even be able to fathom why he thought of this or why he though I would want that. How is that get back? It's nonsensical. If someone was going to make up a story, it would be something closer to standard fucking-hookers-on-hidden-cam, not this.  There's only one person I'm aware of who is so bitter, so vindictive, and so moronic, that they could come up with this situation where you have hookers pee on the bed an enemy once slept in as some sort of dumb fuck retribution: Donald Trump.  So whether it ever gets released or not, that tape sure as fuck exists.
1:::*You want a lil Lahey show?*
1:::"Donnie, my friend, the new batch of Miss America contestants just came in!" 
1:::14, my dude. 14 different numbers.
1:::As where a normal person would reply , throw them both in jail if true.
1:::*"I'm okay with child rape because I believe Bill Clinton is a rapist."*  That's the argument. 
1:::Operation Serval, great documentary on it on youtube, it’s about an hour long and it should be among the first hits when you search it.
1:::That's like the difference between playing COD at 7pm with a bunch if whiny kids vs. 3am when the Asians get on.
1:::I blame it in a lot of Reddit being kids when GWB was president. 
1:::I’m inclined to think that all the recent news inspired Credico to get black out drunk or rail a mountain of booger sugar and lashed out afterwards. 
1:::> Apparently, last night Randy Credico went on a twitter tirade where he tweeted at Trump that Roger Stone had confided in him things about Trump’s perversion and economic crimes going back 37 years that make him believe everything in the dossier is true.

1:::Trump:  "Hey, Barack, I got you so good."  Obama: "What are you talking about?"  Trump: "Remember that time you went to Moscow and slept in a bed?"  Obama: "Yeah."  Trump: "Well, I had hookers pee on it.  Pee!"  Obama: "You had hookers pee in the bed."  Trump: "All over it.  It was totally soaked through."  Obama: "I didn't even notice it was wet."  Trump: "That's because it was way after you had left."  Obama: "So you had hookers pee in the bed you were supposed to sleep in that night."    Trump: "That's the one!  So many hookers, so much pee."  Obama: "You know I'm never going back there, right?"  Trump: "I got you so good."  *And scene.*

1:::I hope the order of those words is correct.
1:::Yup, fuck em both if true.
1:::Thanks for this.
1:::The wiki says there were 4,000 French troops deployed with 2,900 other troops from Africa who were up against 6,500 to 11,500 militants on the other side.  Did those 300 French troops do most of the fighting?
1:::When the movie about this administration comes out, and there will be a movie, they need to act out scenarios like this and they need to do it exactly the same.   Likewise I want to see the conversation about what the original plan was (the Producers, lose the election) and see it intercut with accidentally winning. 
1:::Who he bragged being able to go back stage and gawk at on Howard Stern.
