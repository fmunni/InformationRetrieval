-21:::How are you gonna react when it turns out you and every other whiny Democrat is wrong?
-13:::How dis it feel the first time you topped the charts as a fantasy writer?
-12:::Can you give me an estimate of the amount of pathetic authors who are trying to cash in on anti Trump sentiment with obviously biased and partisan book deals before any evidence of wrongdoing comes out?
-8:::Do you ever feel like sending a Thank You note to Putin for saving us from Hillary? I probably would if I was as smart as you and most of the geniuses in this subreddit. What has helped Putin more, the election of Trump, or the big 2 year nothing-burger that tells the world he is powerful enough to rig our elections? Thanks for your contributions to Putin's power, the neo-McCarthyism used against anyone questioning US foreign policy, and for turning liberals into Birchers that see Russian malfeasance everywhere.
-8:::Yes, Trump should have stayed with deep state, swamp creatures and he would be safe and out of the media's crosshairs. Maybe he'll learn before his next four years but I doubt it.
-6:::Do you think 9/11 was investigated thoroughly?
-6:::Hi Craig. Regarding Trump & Putin relationship, have you been able to find out who is the top and who is the bottom?  &#x200B;  Thanks 
-6:::Why do you feel like lying to Americans for profit? 
-6:::How many people have been convicted of collusion? 
-5:::Do you find it pretentious to call a story “untold,” particularly if you’re telling it?
-5:::Do you worry about finding a real job after you stop swinging from Trump’s ballsack?
-5:::My question is this :  When Russian collusion was brought to the front of news headlines close to 2 years ago, I was shocked and interested at the same time.  After the one year mark, I lost interest because nothing had come to fruition in terms of justice, and was questioned if this was some conspiracy theory, smear campaign or something actually real.  I relate this lightly to Clinton's email scandal. At first I was upset, but after hearing "lock her up!!" for months, and months and months and months...................... and months, nothing happened, I just figured it was some smear tactic.  Like most people (I assume), I want justice to do what is right no matter who is in the white house.  So going on a little over 2 years now, when do you think justice will be served? Or will this get blown over and forgotten about like many political scandals in the past?

1:::Hi Craig,   Given the nature of this investigation, and that new details are continuously being released, why did you write the book when you did, and not in a few years time?
1:::Your book is awesome. I read it a couple months ago  
1:::Given the amount of movement in the past week, does it feel like we are running towards the end game? 
1:::Given all the news of the 24-hours; is it your belief the Moscow pee pee tape was shot in HD or it's just a cell phone recording?
1:::How do you think this is going to play out based on what we have seen this week?
1:::Hi Craig. How do you see this playing out? What's the endgame? 
1:::Is Trump better be off in deep end Siberia or US federal prison?
1:::Do you think when Manafort lost his plea deal that was the writing on the wall for Cohen?
1:::So how does this all end? I mean realistically, how do you see the next decade or so going for the world based on your insight?
1:::Do you ever feel that the Russia scandal is given too much attention over issues that arguably have a bigger impact on people's lives, such as healthcare access, rising suicide rates, global warming or the decline of insect populations across the globe?
1:::Tell me about Alfa bank.
1:::Who are some other journalists and authors you believe have a proven track record of verifying sources before publishing and should be regarded as trustworthy when it comes to Trump-Russia reporting? There was big push back against Luke Harding the other day because of a plagiarizing incident from a decade ago, but that seemed like a poor attempt to bury the Manafort-Assange meeting bombshell. I thought his investigative work for his book "A Most Expensive Poison" was well balanced and provided needed clarity.  Maybe you do not think Luke Harding is one of those trustworthy journalists, who are others potentially like him you are weary of?
1:::Do you think the Public will ever be privy to what really happened via a report, leaks, etc. and if so what timeframe?  Soon after conclusion, 20 years from now, never?
1:::It seems like China is used as a foil for downplaying the relationship between Trump and Russia, but China mostly appears to be taking just a defensive position on these geopolitics while increasing their third-world influence, why is that?
1:::Where did Trump get the sudden influx of cash he used to to fund his 2006-on Golf Course spending spree, and is there any reason to think it may not have actually been his money?  
1:::Do you think we are close to this being over? Will Trump be held responsible?
1:::Having not read your books, but curious about your perspective. What do you think will come of all of this? How will this end?
1:::Do you think Trump will be censored/impeached, or if it will result in him being removed from office? I don't.  What has bewildered me through this whole saga is why the GOP continues to support Trump via their own obstruction. They still have a Republican as President in Pence. Why?
1:::    Hey Craig. Thanks for all your work, the book is a great read!  Here are my two questions. 1) How concerned are you about the broader implications of the Russian’s Trump coup, and wider infiltration into the US political and business elites. Is there a threat that, with so many participants (largely on the Republican side) compromised, even if Mueller does what we hope and wipes out this administration, and its handlers, there will be plenty of room for the less obvious and more skilled Kremlin operatives to secure a “nest” in key government and US positions for years to come? And what can be done to minimize this risk?  And 2) How likely do you think that there may still be coordination between Trump and the Kremlin (even if via intermediaries)? I’ve long suspected that when Mueller is close, we may see a foreign policy distraction pop up, either in Ukraine or North Korea, initiated by the Kremlin. And it seems to be happening now. Seems like a win-win from Putin’s point of view – it may or may not save Trump, but he could take another bite out of Ukraine under the cover of the scandal that’s bound to kick off once the Mueller report is filed and the Dem congress comes in. Or am I being too paranoid here?
1:::So Muller testifying should have some sort of consequence for Trump?
1:::Do you ever have concerns about your safety based on your coverage of this material?   And have you experienced any actual scares as a result of your writings? 
1:::If the GOP Senate is unwilling to convict a House impeachment, for whatever reason, what do you see as the likely endgame? Will it be taken to the Supreme Court whether a sitting president can be criminally indicted?
1:::Given the latest news related to Cohen's new information, can you explain what is likely now to happen with Trump?
1:::Do you feel Trump will step down from office if he loses in 2 years or are we looking at a slow moving coup?
1:::Mr. Unger, I'm a big fan of your work. Your covering of the Bush era, from "House of Saud.." to "Fall of House of Bush.." was actually my first introduction to US politics. So I want to thank you for doing that and this AMA  How much of Russian money do you think is now intertwined into the US financial system today? The money stolen by Putin from  the Russian population. I'm guessing they're probably in US real estate, but what do you think? 
1:::During your investigation I have no doubt you have come across Oleg Deripaska. What have you found out about him? Also what do you know in regards to his relationship with Adam Waldman - the lobbyist who visited Julian Assange 9 times in 2017 and also represented Christopher Steele all the while exchanging texts with Mark Warner?
1:::How do you feel about the 1999 Apartment Bombings in Russia and their relationship to Putin's rise to power?
1:::In light of everything you've presented, what do you think Trump's motivation is for continuing to act in the interests of Russia? He is in a position of enough power that you'd think he could get out from under Putin if he wanted, and he seems to have committed greater crimes for Russia than what he could be charged with otherwise. I've never really been able to understand it from his point of view.
1:::You have dished out some pretty damning information about some scary people. Have you ever felt concerned for your personal safety? 
1:::Given the fervor of the current Republican Party, particularly the support for trump by the base voters, do you think the GOP would actually impeach and convict? 
1:::With everything that has happened so fast this week, what do you think will be the next course of action by Mueller and his team in regards to Trump and pretty much anyone else affiliated in his administration? Furthermore do you think his son and everything that happened at the tower meeting is going to play a bigger role in all of this?
1:::Did you ever come across any good information pertaining to Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein in your research for the book? I realize this tangential to the whole Russia saga, but it is somewhat timely given the amazing story that came out in the Miami Herald yesterday.    I loved the book BTW. It made my commutes far less boring for a bit.  
1:::Hey Craig,  I think we spend a lot of time talking about how awful Trump is and the terrible directions he's leading the US towards. I've found more and more over the past couple years that I need to shut out the news because it just makes me feel helpless reading what's going on.   Do you have any advice for average people like me to get through these difficult times? 
1:::Hi Craig, thanks for doing this. Some really interesting responses to read through.  Do you think that Mueller has the ways and means to get fully to the bottom of all of this? My biggest fear is that those who are guilty will get away with it somehow.
1:::Do you and Cenk Uygur ever have any naming mixups?
1:::Craig, thanks for your work.   I saw you at the NYC screening of Active Measures.   Topical in the  news is Mr Epstein.   Is there more you can tell us about Robert Maxwell and Semion Mogilevich?     
1:::Do you have any idea how many politician across the globe are invested in Trump's presidency?
1:::I know you've already logged off but I wanted to say that I'm currently reading the book and find it fascinating. Thank you for your hard work!
1:::What do you think Putin's next big move is, especially considering the walls are closing in on his asset in the White House? 
1:::How do people like yourself who are seeking the TRUTH and justice deal with death threats, etc?!  As political polarization and rhetoric have intensified, folks like me wonder how to keep dialog alive without potential physical repercussions.  \[Safety in numbers is one way I guess.\]  Obviously verbal abuse is extremely common and we're dealing with people refusing to have intellectually honest conversation.  It's maddening, yet must be dealt with.  Thanks for what you guys do!
1:::What do you think happened to Wikileaks? Was it taken over by Russans? Did Julian Assange want revenge for being forced into the embassy for so long? It used to be respected for it's goals and despised by the people in power.
1:::Do people often confuse you and Cenk Uyger, the Young Turks host?
1:::Great work, my question is not related to your books but culture of Trump, and his Marketing Trump Tower.  Am I crazy thinking Trump tower is decorated the same as the Winter Palace?  Do you think this was done to make the Russians feel like long lost Russian royals?  Just doing some google image searches and it has to at least eco back to the last days of royal power.       
1:::Did John Brennan's hatred of Trump begin even before Trump ran for president?  Brennan's mind seems to be almost in a psychopathic delirium in his rage against Trump. Is there a past history of animus between the two men?
1:::Hey there Craig, have you looked into the Israeli-Russian mafia connections and how solid they are? A lot of reporting suggests that there was a middle eastern side of this 'collusion' story which I like to think about as just another criminal enterprise these guys engaged with, but the Israeli side has been the most mysterious both from the Netanyahu/Kushner connections, the Lev Leviev connections (his right hand man showing up with Cohen recently), Papadopolous being exposed as an Israeli agent and obviously Mogilevich's hand in that part of the world which might be a passive one but certainly one that brought familiarity to all the players involved.   Would love to hear what you've seen there, since it's the murkiest picture we have so far on this whole plot. 
1:::In as short of terms as you can.  Dude, what in the holy hell is going on??? 
1:::Could the Russian numbers station release of 'execute command 135' relate to trump (in terms of timing) if this was his fortune 500 ranking with some offset? 
1:::Does this ever seem like a stupid version of the show Designated Survivor to you?
1:::Specific to NATO and the "attack one of us you attack all of us...". Do you think that the NATO allies of the US are seeing the Trump presidency as an attack on a NATO ally and are responding, in kind to the aggressor or have been caught totally flat footed and don't know or never envisioned this type of scenario/assault? 
1:::My question is pretty simple. We know Trump has been in some shady business for most of his career... why didn’t everyone speak up, write a book, and do more to alert the people “before” he went into office? I despise the man and everything he stands for. I did my own research and formed my own opinion about him before he was ever elected. However, most people just eat up his lies as truth, never questioning. They believe that all journalists speaking out against him and revealing the truth, are just trying to bash the president. Maybe if journalists, news outlets, and other citizens in a position of spreading knowledge, would’ve continually tried to enlighten people, his election could’ve been prevented to begin with. I just don’t understand why now that he’s in office, everyone wants to spread the truth about his deals and lies. I know they say “it’s better late than never,” but what if this time, they’re wrong?
1:::Keep up the good work sir. Not all Hero's wear capes.   Thank you.
1:::Hi Craig.   I'm not a trump supporter but I am a truth supporter,  is there any any physical evidence aside from the real estate project proving trump actually had ties to the Russians and Russia actually tampered with the election? I have seen some many people talking about it, but have not seen solid PROOF Russia was involved with the election. 
1:::No real question just wanted to say I miss your Sirius radio show!
1:::Sounds like Trump is the Russian's useful idiot.
1:::Almost reflexively downvoted because I misread the name as "Cenk Uygar"
1:::How did you get your book published? I’d like to write a book.
1:::**This is by far the best book on the subject.** It has the best parts of all other books in one. Congrats on this superb work.
1:::Hey Craig. Do yo think “journalists” like Acosta help or hurt the fake news industry?  And why are there so many best-selling authors?
1::: Author Craig Unger talked about his new book, 'House of Trump, House of Putin,' Trump's historical ties to Russia, and how the American president and Putin "are bound by more than just an authoritarian streak" in an interview Wednesday night with CNN's Don Lemon.    
1:::cashing in on all the trump hating rubes  capitalism, it works 
1:::You understand the details. Getting this book 
1:::So like, where’s the pee tape and do you think it will premiere on PornHub? 
1:::Is it feasible / possible that Trump would run to Russia to help avoid being sent to prison?   Or, would a string of pardon's follow his conviction? Pence pardons Trump, etc. 
1:::How do you think today's events with Cohen will play out?
1:::What do you think are the intersections between the US Italian/American mafia and Russian organized crime?  It seemed like a HUGE gaping hole in media coverage in the run up to the 2016 election there were no articles I saw about Trump's (and his father's) history of relationships with the US mafia.  IMO the natural question that follows from all this is how Trump made the 'jump' from the US mafia and Russian organized crime, and my presumption that Trump could not have aligned with Russia without US Mafia being OK with it.  There is also an issue of how much clout the US mafia may have with the US mainstream media to keep them from reporting on their (US Mafia's) culpability in all this.

1:::Did you see Black Mass? The FBI was fine overlooking the "small time" Irish mob in Boston, as long as they helped them in taking down their REAL target - the Italian mafia. Sounds kinda familiar, doesn't it?
1:::Also don't forget: Deutsche Bank has been Trump's largest financier for a decade, and may even reveal a link between Justice Anthony Kennedy retiring and Trump. Trump and Kushner have worked with Kennedy's son who is an exec at Deutsche to secure huge loan after huge loan.
1:::> Given how much information is public knowledge about Trump's decades long involvement with Russian mobsters, why do you think it is that Trump has never been prosecuted  My guess is that he just wasn't a priority target before. Or, he may not be that big of a player - as in there are bigger fish out there for them to go after. I'm just speculating of course. 
1:::That were the Russian themselves, indirectly?  [https://ru.reuters.com/article/allBreakingNews/idUKL5N1F71V9](https://ru.reuters.com/article/allBreakingNews/idUKL5N1F71V9)  &#x200B;
1:::I don't think so. It's not really news to most people that they are a state-run mafia, and we are still the USA - they can't just "punish" us without fear of some retribution or something. They also won't be able to fly under the radar anymore after all this stuff comes out - they'll be far more scrutinized and viewed as a serious threat, kinda like the way people here view NK or Iran. 
1:::All those women from Eastern Europe are. They love Putin.

1:::Real questions 🤯😳 
1:::Ask Trump that question.
1:::This an AMA with the *author* not *Trump*.
1:::The salt must flow!
1:::We aren't "a little over two years" for one thing, but even if we were, it took two years for Watergate to precipitate in Nixon's resignation...and Mueller plans to drop his report before EOY, so this is right on pace with Watergate. Sorry that's too slow for your patience, but that's how long a thorough investigation takes.
1:::There’s been blood. 
1:::Foundation of geopolitics to a tee.
1:::Is this some sort of synopsis bot? 
1:::Did you do any comparative analysis of Russian sound names in other luxury residential buildings, just to be sure?
1:::If that was the Johnny Depp one, then yes. I'm familiar with the saga of Whitey Bulger and the FBI. I think Whitey is probably the most corrupt and evil person in American history.
1:::> I believe most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money.   This is the only reasonable explanation for why they have been so slow to do anything about Trump's obvious shady dealings. 
1:::> I believe most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee run by Mitch McConnell got millions from Leonard Blavatnik.  Do you think this is part of the reason they're so willing to cover for Trump now, even when it requires so much hypocrisy and so many compromises of their stated ethics & principles? Does Trump KNOW they're compromised and/or complicit?   I know, those sound like REALLY obvious questions, but your'e the expert here. 
1:::I’m pretty sure trump’s father was owned by the Russian mob and that DJT was born into it, owned by birth. 
1:::Thank you for the answer, just got back to the computer and saw it.  Maybe you could interview me sometime :)
1:::"serving Russian interests" when you're the POTUS, to me is a big, fat, orange traitor (with small hands)
1:::Is it possible that he has been trained by the Russians or is it just coincidence that he follows the Kremlin Playbook?
1:::we thank you 
1:::Does that differentiate the Russian Mafia that they essentially are an asset of the government? And has that played a role in making them more successful overtime and especially in instances of cultivating useful idiots?
1:::Well, my follow up question leads in that direction exactly - once we’re all globally ganging up on Russia and probably demand Putin’s removal while they experience harsh isolation globally (just based on assumptions, I don’t know global politics that well at all) - they’re going to likely act like cornered maniacs, no? I can’t see this not leading to dire and direct conflict in the end, ultimately.  
1:::Worried about what? You’ll be fine Craig, the president has no clue you exist.
1:::Nice projection. Easy to do 
1:::Yeah he does that too
1:::I would gladly admit I was wrong.   And then I'd be delighted because that would mean Mike Pence would be his replacement. 
1:::> Trump has upended all of that, and it seems impossible to believe that, however euphoric it was for Putin at first, that this is still the end he desired  It may not be NOW, right this moment, but the story isn't over yet - it's ongoing, and you can never predict every potential side-effect. I think you are getting a bit in the weeds, and maybe it's some confirmation bias too, because many of us would LOVE to go to bed at night believing that Putin is no longer happy with this shit-storm that he created, but most likely that isn't the case. He got what he really wanted, he has destabilized the US and their power over many other countries, AND he gets pretty much all of the credit, and then fear that comes with it. What he has done sends a strong message to other countries, that he could enact the same type of thing onto them. 
1:::> a massive tide of furious anger both domestic and abroad towards Putin, probably around the time of 2020  With everything that has come out about Putin, how has not a single nation managed to get to him yet?  Like how is it that we are able to find terrorists in caves on the other side of the world, and hit them with a missile that costs a thousand times more than the terrorists' entire village, and Putin runs around free for decades, in the public eye.  
1:::Brilliant. I totally agree with you. Like Oscar Wilde said:   « When the Gods wish to punish us, they answer our prayers. »  
1:::Okay, no, no no- but with the penchant for gaslighting, there can't be any truth to the whole pizzagate thing and the Russian mob...  And, while our heads have been turned toward the Russian mob in all this, what about the Triad and Chinese mob interests- does anything intersect there with regards to our trade war?   yikes...  <peers down hole, sees rabbits scurry>
1:::I imagine they give you the royal treatment, roll out the red carpet, put you up in a gorgeous hotel, and then shower you with vices - specifically Russian Women (unless they're not your thing) - all the while, they control the entire building and pretty much everything in it. The room is bugged, the staff is bugged and gathering evidence on you - they're also debriefing someone after every encounter, so they can report on everything you do and everything they see in the room. 
1:::I think Cohen has a Ukrainian wife.  Double check 
1:::When Obama, and by extension Hilary, got into office in 2008. A lot of that was just timing and serendipity, because if McCain had won in 2008, he arguably would have been even HARDER on Putin & Russia than Obama / Clinton were, but it didn't happen like that, so anything that happened during that time (and a lot of it was imagined - like Putin looked at things like the Arab spring and Gaddafi and saw it as the US basically saying "look what we can do, and look what we can do to you") - he literally saw messages in the sand that weren't there, and he blamed the sitting admin at the time for them. Clinton was part of that admin, and was a shoe-in candidate in 2016. Putin didn't want that to happen. 
1:::and why Turtle wont let the Muller protection bill go through the Senate 
1:::If only the people of Kentucky could see the light.
1:::McClatchy mentions it [here](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article195231139.html):  > Two people with close connections to the powerful gun lobby said its total election spending actually approached or exceeded $70 million. The reporting gap could be explained by the fact that independent groups are not required to reveal how much they spend on Internet ads or field operations, including get-out-the-vote efforts.
1:::We would need a youth-driven rebirth of the Republican Party, similar to what is happening with the Democrats. If you’re stuck living with a crazy person, all you can do is try to convince them to get help, and hope they do so before they kill you.
1:::>  the first war  do you refer to the civil war that way in Georgia ?
1:::Not all civil wars involve bullets. I cannot go a day without seeing parallels to multiple covert and clandestine operations that occured in south america and beyond at the hands of intelligence operatives from various foreign nations as well as the USA. Culture Wars are civil wars that don't necessarily reach a boiling point but they do simmer and they do result in change for entire nations. 
1:::Odd, I assumed he forgot an "of". Shred of National Narative was rather poetic.
1:::You might be pleased to hear that Richard Spencer's wife is working on an English translation.
1:::It's a copyright issue.  The Russian publisher and copyright holder obviously does not want this more accessible.  Translations would be subject to pesky copyright laws, and would only be available illegally.  
1:::This guy thinks he’s hot shit huh
1:::And be instantly rejected in his request. Anyone can request asylum, doesn't mean you get it
1:::Yet more legitimate than the fantasy alibi propaganda Trump's state media and fanboys are pushing.
1:::I think people are giving Putin the benefit of the doubt a little too quickly and using hindsight to retcon his intentions.  He's had a number of high profile failures lately and I think a number of aborted schemes.  Take the Sochi Olympics, for example.  He tried to *covertly* rig the Olympics, got caught and ended up getting his country banned from international sporting events.    Or the international sanctions that are still hurting his inner circle  Or the exposure of his troll farms allowing other countries and its citizens to defend against their influence.  Or the failed Skripal poisoning  Or being outed as responsible for the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crash  Or when the Dutch security service hacked into the GRU's own office surveillance cameras and reported their actions to the United States in real time as they tried to access their systems  These were not part of some 4D chess maneuver; these were failures regardless of how successful or not they were at avoiding consequences for these failures.  And these are just the failures that we know about.  How many systems did they fail to access after their outing caused people to beef up their security?  No respected country is looking to Russia for leadership.  They may have taken the United States down a notch but they took themselves with it and then some.  In a matter of months Putin took a country that was secretly asserting their influence all over the place and treated as an equal on the global stage and turned them into an untrustworthy pariah.  It's going to take a long time before they regain any of that international trust back
1:::>and Putin runs around free for decades, in the public eye.   Because a terrorist is not the embodiment of power of a sovereign nation.   We know exactly where Putin lives; but to murder him outright would be a declaration of formal war.  No one really wants formal war; they want to posture, they want to gain territory inch by inch.  But they don't want outright armed conflict.   Look at Iraq - a much, much, *much* smaller nation relative to Russia, where America did just that.  Stormed in, overthrew the dictator, killed him, and - 20 years and 5 trillion dollars later, we have ISIS and a region in grave turmoil.   If Putin is murdered, someone else just steps up.  He's just one of many.  There is a cabal of oligarchs and no shortage of soviet-era intelligence agents who would love the chance to step into the Presidency with the tool of righteous fury at their side to condemn America for their act of hostility.   
1:::Good analysis. Thanks. 
1:::Matt Christman, Chapo Trap House. 
1:::A cold civil war
1:::Yay! I was starting to think that I was going to have to learn Russian to be able to read it!
1:::Shouldn't Google be able to help speed that up?
1:::If I’m not wrong, the biggest Russian publishers are stared owned. 
1:::Yeah, to these people it's 'our team, our team!' Not 'Of the people, by the people and for the people.' This is entirely about tribalism and the vast majority of Americans and people around the world are not part of 'Planet Alabama'. . .
1:::Yes, but that has nothing to do with the SS tailing him.
1:::What’s even more sad is politics is your hobby. Not healthy man. And all the people on the left and right. Caught in a sky is falling shit storm of sensationalized news. Chew on that for a while 
1:::Hurt the oligarchs = hurt Putin. That should be the goal.
1:::In the grand scheme of things, none of those failures are even remotely relevant if the 3 branches of US government have been compromised to the extent that they seem to have been. I'm not certain that the legal foundation the government rests upon is as structurally sound as most people assume it is.
1:::> Because a terrorist is not the embodiment of power of a sovereign nation.  You're not wrong at all, my comment was more along the lines of "How does a guy with as many enemies as Putin does stay alive all this time?"
1:::I don't know the history there, but even if true, Putin has consolidated his power since the arrest of Khodorkovsky. Mogilevich's money laundering network and global crime syndicate are, I'm sure, quite valuable to Putin and the oligarchs, but Putin wears the ring.
1:::Yeah, I wouldn't pay it any mind. She/her family is from Meriden CT, nearby Manafort's hometown, New Britain. The Manafort family has a large construction type business, which Paul was never part of, apparently. Anyway, that's the supposed connex (if any) - that her dad was a city manager and contracted with/from Manafort construction? Something like that. Big whoop. FTR, I also grew up in a neighboring town to Manafort's, and had family in construction that likely worked for/with Manafort Brothers. None of us are traitorous fvcks. Lol
1:::That's white supremacy. Whether it be out of fear or pride it's still the same end and methods.
1:::Me too, fellow patriot, me too. In really saddened to see what this country has become.
1:::You're talking in circles. He can't run and hide because the Secret Service (you REALLY shouldn't abbreviate that) is always with him. Sure, he could walk into an embassy with them in tow and request asylum...but unless he gets the asylum (which he won't) he'll be shown the door with his security detail. So what is your point exactly? That his secret service detail isn't the *only* thing stopping him from making a break for it?
1:::Well, if could all strive to be such an enlightened centrist as you...
1:::A 9 year old on the playground would know that's a lame, bullshit response. Put up or shut up.  Real reporters and investigative journalists use anonymous sources for a reason and you know that. 
1:::What an uninformed, ignorant, limp-dick excuse. No, it doesn't work for you. It works for high-profile, trusted people that put their REAL names on their stories, and that have the backing & support of editorial boards and institutions with DECADES of experience and a reputation for journalism. Anonymous trolls on message boards don't get to use that claim.  
1:::"*seem to have been*" is the key phrase here.    I gave you actual examples of his failures and you counter with a hypothetical that doesn't jive with the numerous news stories this week and month that indicate the system is stronger than that.  People are basing opinions and coming to conclusions partly because of orchestrated misinformation.  And one of those things I see a lot of is Putin's success as a leader and strategist.  Except it isn't true.  He's had a significant number of major missteps and that does not bode well for any continued success at compromising the three levels of government.
1:::By keeping powerful people wealthy.   Actually, it's suspected that alleviating sanctions through electing Trump is as much about his national interests as it is about his personal interests.   Everyone knows that the oligarchs are as much the government of Russia as the actual government.  They live in sort of a mutually beneficial stalemate, but they are being crushed by sanctions.   It's often the case that the most dangerous enemies are one's allies.
1:::Yes, therefore he owns Putin
1:::and for giving any credit or ground to the left. Many arguments are framed around "no, that's not right - WE are right on this, our side is right" - and that's something they don't want to admit or accept. By playing the "both sides" card, they stop short of giving us the credit we want, and admitting that we are right.

1:::> So what is your point exactly? That his secret service detail isn't the *only* thing stopping him from making a break for it?   Yes.
1:::If claiming not having politics as a hobby is self “enlightening” and “centrist”  I must have made you feel some sort of way. Looks like it struck a deep nerve. It’s okay. Sleep on it. Might take you a while 
1:::I actually don't think they know that. They don't seem smart enough. 
1:::What particular steps to you see leading to a healthy post-Trump USA? The evidence is mounting that a presidential campaign conspired with a hostile foreign power in a country where the only way to remove a sitting president is via impeachment, where the House initiates and the Senate convicts. The party that currently holds the Senate majority is the party that has apparently been accepting money from and communicating with Russian assets and/or operatives. The President of the Senate is Mike Pence, a man hand picked for the role of VP by Paul Manafort.  The president cannot be charged with anything without first being impeached; I don't see a compromised Senate voting to impeach him, which means the checks and balances are compromised.   If he is impeached and convicted by the Senate, and removed from his role, the next in line is Mike Pence. He would also have to be convicted by the Senate; the line of succession after the VP is Paul Ryan, Orrin Hatch, Mike Pompeo, Steve Mnuchin, James Mattis, (maybe) Matthew Whittaker, and Ryan Zinke; it also includes Wilbur Ross, Ben Carson, Betsey DeVos, Elaine Chao, and Kirstjen Nielson for good measure. Suffice to say that I don't see any of them escaping the taint of the original conspiracy conviction.  If the Senate refuses point blank to convict after the House has initiated proceedings, there is no other recourse that I'm aware of; if it is true that the campaign conspired with a foreign country, and the legislative branch does not act to check the executive, the concept of the US federal government as conceived is effectively and practically destroyed. Even if the special counsel publicizes evidence of conspiracy, there is no other legal mechanism by which the president could be held responsible without Senate cooperation. If by chance he is removed, I'm not aware of a legal mechanism by which they can remove appointments made by the deposed president, nor is there a way to hold a new election.   What are you seeing that I'm not?
1:::Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.
1:::There are rumors going around that the oligarchs are not happy with Putin.  It is because of his ambitions that we're in this new cold war.  If he tapered his ambitions, did not invade Ukraine, did not mess in other country's politics, they would not have these sanctions to begin with.  All this meddling is just them attempting to dig themselves out of this pit they created.
1:::Nah, it's mostly dedicated to scientific articles, emotional support, and collapse prepping. Fun stuff.
1:::a deep nerve? lol it is hilarious how you take yourself seriously.  As if I gave the bumbling nonsense you are ranting about much of a thought. Hang in there, kid, I am sure your mom thinks your ramblings are relevant.
1:::Come January, after Pence, Pelosi or whoever the Dems choose for speaker is next in line. 
1:::I have no idea if those rumours are true or not, but I believe the majority of the current oligarchs were in governing or intelligence roles in the USSR. They were not born and raised in a free capitalist society like the US, and therefore perceive the world and their own interests in a way which the west generally cannot relate to.
1:::Fair. Do you believe that if the Democratic House impeaches the President and Vice President, the Republican Senate will convict them?
1:::I agree.  I wish I could find the article.  I remember reading it about six months ago from actually a pretty reputable source.  Lots of uncertainty either way.
2:::What do you think of the recent news drops (Manafort, Stone, Corsi, Assange, Cohen, Deutsche Bank raid, Trump Tower Moscow, Putin & Ukraine, etc) and how does this all play out?  P.s. do you think the EU will pass Magnitsky Act & how will that affect things?
2:::How deep is Russian influence inside the Republican Party? Many members of the GOP seem to be willing to risk themselves to criminal charges, Devin Nunes is the obvious one, and is that because they fear pressure from outside extortion?
2:::do you think the russians have evidence of trump with underage prostitutes? 
2:::I don't have any questions. I just wanted to say that I loved your book.
2:::Is Trump, legally speaking, fucked?  &#x200B;  Hey, you said "ask me anything".
2:::Have you also got a raging justice boner after today’s events?
2:::Do you have an official food taster? Because you should. Stay safe, man. And thank you!
2:::Your work is amazing! Thank you for putting it out. You keep me well informed.
2:::I've seen your interviews on the Majority Report and have read your articles concerning money-laundering in the Trump Tower apartments; your work is extremely impressive and I thank you for your journalism.  **My question:** Are you at all irritated/concerned at the way most media companies have portrayed both the probe *and* Trump's criminality thus far?  It seems that they're not seeing the forest for the trees (as it pertains to each weekly development of Trump's rampant corruption and illegal dealings). I feel as though many major media outlets are failing to capture the *essence* of what makes this a big deal; it's not necessarily that Trump is a literal sock-puppet for Putin, nor that he harbors any specific nationalistic affinity for Russia, but that he is a shining example of the influences of dark money in both business and politics. It just seems that with every story that breaks, we're collectively losing grasp of which aspects of this "story" are the main plot, the subplots, and the red herrings-- so to speak. From what I've read these past two years, your reporting is the **core** of the issue; Trump is clearly on the bankroll of the Russians (through laundering). It seems that's nearly been lost among a sea of minor characters, like Giuliani, and minor weekly updates to details that history will likely gloss over as relatively unimportant to the main event.  How important is it to distill the information at this point, I suppose?
2:::Craig, you've said that you've heard that Trump's sexual exploits have been much sicker than the pee tape. That's quite a tease. So:  Rouged cheeks, lisping, pigtails.  How warm am I?
2:::Thank you for your work and all you do to help keep us all informed!! Big fan!
2:::That's probably a name Democrats and Republicans alike will keep away from an investigation. 
2:::Republicans did that before in Maryland for years so you just know they’ll do it again. 
2:::He could go to an embassy during a trip abroad and claim asylum
2:::Around the end of the cold war, if you were to ask Putin.
2:::Careful with her as a source her dad worked with Manafort 
2:::I agree, but what do you think the odds are of Trump encouraging his most die-hard supporters to rise up and overthrow the "tyrannical" government when he's forced to leave office (whether by Senate indictment or a lost election)?
2:::I hate how right you are. 
2:::No way. Putin is the top mobster in Russia.
2:::I agree. You would be welcome to join us over at r/collapse.
2:::For some reason, that r/ sounds like it is going to be tortured depressive reading. Pass.
2:::I don't need to be 'specific' to know that Giuliani is a man completely without principle.
3:::Is Jeffrey Epstein related to (a subject of) the the investigation, as far as you are aware?
3:::Who bought 19% of Rosneft? Do you ever expect to find out?
3:::Since the Russian mob is literally just the government should we be concerned as a country once they’ve been exposed and poised for serious punishment?
3:::What do you believe will be the endgame of Mueller's investigation? Will those close to Trump like Kushner and Don Jr. face indcitment? Also if Trump is found out, will Republicans turn on him and impeach him?
3:::Do you feel Pence ties into this in any way? He was Manforts pick. In some ways he is a more scary guy than Trump because of his stronger connection with "Supply Jesus", and those who follow some version of that mantra.
3:::Do you know if trump went alone in 87 or did he bring anyone in his family? I’m thinking his family is involved in the kompromat too.
3:::> my book traces all these relationships.  Can't help but wonder if a board with pictures connected with yarn was involved.
3:::Link to the NYTimes article, complete with quotes from Cohen that have been overturned by today's plea deal: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/us/politics/trump-tower-putin-felix-sater.amp.html
3:::The investigation isn’t over. Trump is already an unindicted coconspirator in the Cohen case
3:::Mogilevich is the oligarch that made Putin supreme ruler of Russia.
3:::>Maybe not the $70 million claimed   I appreciate the link, I read the Feinstein report.  Would still like to know the facts supporting his statement regarding that exact number.  
3:::100% percent wrong about Qanon's passion. They don't want to solve real issues, they take their quarter from knowing the "facts" that the rest of the world doesn't. If bigfoot were actually discovered, they would most likely switch to "this new bigfoot is a fraud". It's a pathological thing...  Edit: I have a friend in Switzerland, a tenured professor of linguistics, speaking 11 fluent languages....yep, she fell into the Qanon school. It's seriously a mental health issue I think's.
3:::It’s both — don’t think everyone doesn’t have knives out for one another, and will use them given the chance. From all I’ve read it’s coop-itition on a very precarious foundation. Too much money — read: power — at stake for gentlemen’s agreements to reign. 
3:::The ones who won  - because clearly Giuliani's actions did not rid NYC of all the mafia.
3:::I went to college for precision machining but ive spent a few thousand hours researching this, might as well have a degree lol.. I shouldve invested that time into a political science and law degree.
3:::This whole fiasco is both fascinating, and horrifying at the same time.  /trumpshowaddict
4:::How do you think Mike Pence fits into any of this if at all? We know he was pushed on Trump by Paul Manafort. Two articles I read stated that Mike Pences name was absent from the transition teams e-mails even though he lead it. 
4:::Is Melania Trump's handler?
4:::Is Melania a planted asset for the Kremlin?
4:::Na, McConnell is compromised. He's got lots of Russian money in his bank account. Ryan, I'm not sure of but likely not. 
4:::How are *you* going to react when Trump and his family are indicted and proven to be liars?
4:::You should pay more attention.
4:::just to get a handle on the depth of this thing   1-What was the deal with nunes midnight run to oval office and nunes motivation for be so transparently anti oversight?  2-whats the big deal with carter page and the fisa thing?  3-did the russins also hack republican emails as well as democratic ones?  I know these are probably long, complicated answers but any insght would be appreciated.
4:::Shhhh. That's how we know we're family.
4:::His campaign was full of swamp creatures and criminal thugs, and his current admin is full of swamp creatures, mega-donors, and Goldman Sachs execs.    What are you talking about?  
4:::Spot on sir.
4:::Hmm, I can only find one source that talks anything about that, russiarevealed.info which I cannot even reach the site to read about it.  I am not sure where you got that information since a Google search is finding one unreachable source.
4:::Yeah, no. It doesn't work that way. 
5:::Nothing came of it except 20+ indictments, half a dozen plea deals, and four or five prison terms so far
5:::Brilliant. Why fight a war against a country when you can pay less than the cost of a professional sports arena to buy the people who run it?
5:::Thanks, I see your point.  I disagree on the level that one should not allow your opponent to choose the ground on which you are to fight.  But I do see the value in us having a more robust information warfare capacity.
5:::Just don't drink the tea.
5:::If you're in debt to the Russians, you are in debt to Putin.  
5:::This is exactly it. Let's not beat around the bush, this is about White "supremacy." 
5:::Wasn't he the guy who's kinda holding the oligarchs back from acting as group against Putin?
5:::It's both. Without Mogilevich's support Putin would be gone within months and vice versa. 
6:::Given how much information is public knowledge about Trump's decades long involvement with Russian mobsters, why do you think it is that Trump has never been prosecuted?  The way I see it is, if we already know as much as we do, presumably the FBI has been well aware of who Trump is for decades.    Something I have occasionally wondered is: could it be possible that Trump has been an FBI informant in the past and was therefore protected from indictments?  I just cannot understand why a known criminal was allowed to remain free for so long and to be elected President!  Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA!  Your book sounds fascinating.  It is a topic that more people need to be aware of.  Hopefully the Special Council will wake people up to the reality of Trump's Russia connections soon!  Considering this, how is it that Trump was even allowed to run for President in the first place?  If the FBI was aware of Trump's foreign mob ties, shouldn't they have indicted him to prevent a Russian asset from becoming President?
6:::How do they typically do it, I wonder, and how did they do it with Trump?  Did Kalugin mention whether its a hard intimidation, outright and open threats, or is it sort of a teasing, laughing, "we know what you did", with the threat left hanging out there?    
6:::Given that the Special Counsel's mandate is to investigate all forms of Russian "meddling" in the 2016 election, do you think that Mueller & Co. are digging in to Russian monetary contributions to politicians outside of Trump & Co.? Or would such an investigation be recommended to congress?
6:::>There is no longer a shred national narrative.  I know it's a typo for "shared" but really what we do have is a shredded national narrative. Sometimes autocorrect is wise. 
6:::Be sure not to pop into any consulate buildings in foreign countries - please!
6:::> it seems unlikely to me he had corrupt LCN ties      That's not what's being suggested. We're wondering if Rudy did or now does have corrupt ties with the Russian mafia and if his zealous prosecution of LCN was because of those ties or that he's being awarded now in retrospect for eliminating the competition for Russian mafia.  My thoughts are that it is deeply suspicious that a man who was so zealous about racketeering and organized crime is so cozy with Trump and shady Russian businessmen now.
6:::That's my question too. We already know that an unnamed US congressional candidate received stolen documents (emails) from Guccifer 2.0 (the GRU). Surely that will receive some follow up.
6:::In my opinion, about 20% of the people not paying attention to the investigation would if Fox News disappeared overnight. A lot of Trump supporters aren’t idiots—they just have poor media literacy and critical thinking skills. I think minus the Fox News narrative, a lot of the “QAnon” types would actually be pretty engaged with following the complexities and connecting the dots in this ultimate detective story.  The other 80%? They’re simple bitches. They either simply don’t care and don’t see how politics affects them personally (and couldn’t care less about anything that doesn’t effect them or their immediate family directly—they don’t think of themselves as part of a “society” and a democracy), or they are complete idiots. Not the bright ones who play idiots because they’re trolling—as annoying as those stunted people are, they are part of the 20%. I’m talking about the ones who you try to explain this to and they just stare at you slack-jawed and then say “Well, Trump said no collusion? And I haven’t seen the pee tape, so this is all a witch hunt”. And they actual believe that, or they’re too intellectually lazy to debate you or to investigate the issue on their own.   There are a lot of people who don’t like to think. They like the media to think for them and tell them what they want to hear. And they don’t have the critical thinking capabilities to question what they’re being told, only that it spikes their endorphins. This is the brilliance/extreme danger of Fox News. It’s literally a drug effecting the brain’s release of feel-good chemicals. And who needs truth when you feel good, right?
6:::But Russia chose the ground of conventional warfare first, when it attacked Ukraine and Georgia militarily.   In all likelihood they would prefer to *incite* an open attack from the US, not because they think they would win militarily; they wouldn't, they're comically outmatched by us and would stand little to no chance.   But because they would use that attack in the court of public opinion - fomenting anger towards us from other nations, branding us the aggressors, the world police.   And besides, in conventional warfare, your goal is to annihilate your enemy.  Seize their bases, destroy their government, occupy their territory.   None of this is feasible.  We can defeat them in small skirmishes, but we can't use those victories to press further into Russia - the implications would be cataclysmic for us.    We have to fight them precisely as they fought us.  Putin is *far* more vulnerable to his population.  There is a rebellion surging in Russia.  Their economy is dismal, their youths are restless, angry, and yearning for legitimate freedom.   That's how we fight them.  We have, *by far*, the superior psyops and cyberintelligence skills and might, we've just seldom ever bothered to use them at scale.
6:::Deep state doesn’t exist. 
6:::Odds are 100%. I am not worried about a bunch of basement dweller badasses, or baby boomers who can barely waddle out of their rascal scooters.   He will raise holy hell if his kids are indicted, or he loses the election. There will probably be some muted protests form his supporters and that'll be that.   We haven't quite reached the tipping point.    We're still a ways away from ripping ourselves apart. Another ten-fifteen years like this and we'll be getting close. Something worth looking at is Sir John Glubb's, "On the Fate of Empires." We're in the last stage, so something is coming, just not sure what yet.    If I had to take a bet, I would say it's going to start with the economy, which is so, so close to tipping again. And this time we don't have anyone at the helm to keep it from fully falling apart. Couple this with an overly inflated GLOBAL property market, mostly from China (which is propping up it's own economy). Or subprime car loans, even bigger than too big to fail, In which case, the next fall is going to hit really, really hard and be global.   When you start to see people in the streets for weeks on end, start getting a bail out plan ready.   I am not saying with all certainty that something is coming, but the patterns are all there. Maybe we'll get our shit together, who knows.   EDIT: from Glubb's essay: "The age of decadence is the decay of the empire. It is characterized by defensive minded militaries, decaying morals, lost of religion, frivolous consumption of food, entertainment, sex, and the complete focus of individual interests." 
6:::I’m actually a Virginian, I just moved here recently, but I’ve heard lots of ways to refer to it.  The war of northern aggression is one I hear a lot.  Some referred to it as a failed second revolution.  The war was lost the minute it stared. The Southern strategy was never to beat the Union. outright, what they were hoping for was British and French recognition which would then force Lincoln to sue for peace.   So whatever flowery bullshit people want to say here, it was a crushed rebellion. And reconstruction was nearly as bad as the war itself.  It would be BEYOND stupid for anyone to try that again. 
6:::The false equivalency scam is popular with right wingers because it provides the backdrop for doubting the truth.
6:::The more openly a mob can initiate corrupt activities, and the more locations within which it can do so (the creation of LLCs in the US was a boon to them), the more money and power they accrue.  Minored in international relations, watched a whole lotta mob movies lol
7:::You guys encouraged that behavior with regards to Hillary Clinton, and none of her friends were getting indicted like Trumps.    What made you guy change your tune?  
7:::> The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee run by Mitch McConnell got millions from Leonard Blavatnik.   Well that may help explain a lot.
7:::Trump will be out of office before any double takes are taken.
7:::Because it isn't about truth to them, it is about winning the game of tribalism and nothing else matters to them.
7:::The whole “both parties” are corrupt theme that plays out amongst many here on Reddit, though essentially true, stops short of taking the final intellectual step: which side is demonstrably more corrupt, and moreover, morally vacuous? When taking that final step, the lesser of two evils becomes a moot issue regarding the parties. One side is evil, period. The other side may be corrupt, broken, misguided, or whatever, but evil is not even remotely an appropriate adjective to describe the Democrats. Sorry, GOP, but it fits you perfectly. 
8:::Thank you for taking the time to answer me!
8:::That's not what I'm saying really.  Its almost like a subconscious realization that the white majority of the past did horrible things to nonwhites and if whites become the minority the same thing will happen to them.  The racism is  a pretext for a pragmatic decision to abandon democracy and hitch one's wagon to a dictator who promises to maintain their status by brute force.
8:::I appreciate your effort but the chance this commenter actually understands why that is relevant is exactly zero.
9:::Thanks for doing this Craig!  Do you believe that Trump will peacefully leave office (through election or conviction post-impeachment)? 
9:::When the contents of Steele's raw intel reports were made public, the stuff about the Rosneft deal (that Trump would get the broker's cut of a US$19bn sale if he could get the Magnitsky Act sanctions lifted) sounded completely preposterous.   Then a US$19.5bn deal went through to "sell" part of Rosneft, with the details of the deal being very "murky" to say the least.  The Magnitsky Act sanctions are still in place, and there's no sign that Trump got the hundreds of millions of dollars, but did you find anything to support what Steele reported his Russian sources claimed about Trump and Rosneft?
9:::Right. That's a possibility I had in mind.   I was trying to ask a question that a credible journalist would feel comfortable answering. "Do you find this suspicious...?" I felt was more open to explanation than "Do you think Rudy is mobbed up with the Russians?"
9:::Would you say that surviving members of the post-Soviet Oligarchy coexisting with the Russian Mob, or are they a part of it?
9:::This is brilliant marketing! Don't take me wrong, I've read every single word, but all your posts have reminded me to order your book. Congratulations!
9:::Thanks for your reply and I sincerely enjoyed reading House of Bush, House of Saud.  Cheers!
9:::Not only Russia is a threat, but China has perfected information warfare via their closed media environment. Russia is the current threat, yes, but their expertise makes them an ankle-biter in comparison. Military options are looking more and more antiquated thru that lens and the US’ capacity is far behind even Russia at the moment. We need to shore up *that* disparity rather than focus solely on military might, where everyone and their brother already acknowledges that we’ve got the biggest stick by far. 
9:::In January, when the House starts firing its subpoena cannon and drags people into open hearings 
9:::You must have a source for him being a truther then, right? I'll wait.
10:::At the end of the day, don't you think Mogelivich kisses Putin's ring?
10:::Its time to stop pretending there are two equal sides.  &#x200B;  There is the intellectually and morally superior side, and then there are the right wingers.  &#x200B;  The right hates that we Reddit-browsing and NPR-listening coastal liberal "elites" are the winners in a service-based globalized multicultural society because of our open worldview, and they blame all their failures on minorities and undocumented immigrants. They are seeing how America is increasingly becoming vibrantly diverse, and how non-white people will soon be the majority and losing their privilege terrifies them.  &#x200B;  I've come to realize that much of American history is made up of periods where liberals drag conservatives kicking and screaming into the future, then we try to compromise for a while, then we go back to dragging.  &#x200B;  "No, conservatives, we're not going back to England."  &#x200B;  "No, conservatives, we're not making George Washington a King."  &#x200B;  "No, conservatives, you can't form your own country with blackjack and slaves."  &#x200B;  "No, conservatives, you can't keep denying women the right to votes."  &#x200B;  "No, conservatives, we're not going back to the way things were before the depression."  &#x200B;  "No, conservatives, literacy tests aren't constitutional."  &#x200B;  "No, conservatives, you can't deny homosexuals the right to marry."  &#x200B;  The names of the parties change from era to era, but it's always been liberals dragging conservatives against their will into a better future. I grew up in one of the in-between eras, where we all thought that compromise was a possibility, but I'm more and more realizing how mistaken I was about that. It's time once again for liberals and progressives to stop being nice and drag our country into the 21st century.  &#x200B;  The simple fact of the matter is that conservatives just aren't offering any good ideas any more. What's the compromise between "We need to stop climate change" and "Lol, climate change isn't a real?" Or "Homosexuals should have the right to marry" and "Homosexuals cause hurricanes?" It's like being in a group project with someone who didn't read the book and expecting them to do their share of the work.
10:::Are you a Trusted author with an established body of work?
11:::Mogilevich gave Putin his position of power in Russia.
12:::Are you worried that the president will throw you in jail when he inevitably suspends habeas corpus and seeks to have all of his political enemies incarcerated? 
12:::>  Felix Sater and who he is.   Funny - I just dug up this quote from an email (I think from 2015) that NY Times published in 2017:  >Michael I arranged for Ivanka to sit in Putin's private chair at this desk and office in the Kremlin. I will get PUtin on this program and we will get Donald elected. We both know and no one else knows how to pull off this without stupidity or greed getting in the way. I know how to play it and we will get this done. Buddy our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it. I will get all of Putin's team to buy in on this.
13:::What do you think is the most underrated fact regarding the Trump-Russia connection?  thanks also for the ama!
13:::All Americans should be happy that Mueller is indicting criminals.  Just because they are Trumps best friends doesn’t mean they get a pass.    It’s lost on no one that the only people upset about that come from the “law and order” party.  
13:::Do you think RNC figures like McConnell are under Mueller investigation and in danger of criminal charges?
13:::The Authoritarians by Bob Altemeyer would be a great book to start with to answer this question.
13:::I hope you’re right
13:::He [reported](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/10/saving-the-saudis-200310) in 2003 that the Bush admin helped secure flights for Saudis, including parts of bin Laden's very large family out of the country.   I wouldn't exactly call that a conspiracy theory when it is what happened. 
13:::Other way around
14:::Simion is an extremely powerful mobster. I'd bet money that if Trump is in massive debt with the Russians, he owes Mogelivich, not Putin.
14:::At what point did things with Russia shift from just being about the mafia and usual mob business to trying to undermine democracy and destroy the US?
14:::Speaking of the Russian playbook, have you looked at [*The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics) by Aleksandr Dugin?  I am unable to find an English translation of it but it seems to spell out much of what Russia has been up to.
14:::I'm not Craig Unger but my two cents? The two go hand-in-hand. Worldwide organized crime like the modern Mafiya cannot thrive in a business context with strict, respected soft power of the US and her allies. From sowing discord in society online to actively picking and installing preferred candidates, the Russian government (which is essentially one and the same with its Mafiya, see Semyon Mogelivich for further case on that) weakens the ground international alliances have to stand on to stop the exporting of mob practices.
15:::Are you watching over your shoulder for some Putin-boogeymen to come for you? 
15:::Do you think we are hitting end game time with this investigation and Trump’s presidency?
15:::As a Southerner whose family helped start the first war, including some on confederate money; I need to point out just how destructive the first war was. The South hasn't actually recovered, even today.   This would be a horrible option, but considering Trump has made enemies out of our intelligence community and routinely insults troops, or just doesn't give a shit about them, I question who exactly would fire.   Trump does not have the numbers to pull something like that off, outside of lone wolf bull shit. He'd fail.   And, I need to point out, we're still a LONG, LONG way from Burning Kansas. I'd agree, partisanship is awful right now, but we're not even close to a civil war. 
15:::When U.S. democracy wounded the mafia and usual mob business. So around 2012.  >The Magnitsky Act, formally known as the Russia and Moldova Jackson–Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012, is a bipartisan bill passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in December 2012, intending to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of Russian tax accountant Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow prison in 2009.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitsky_Act
17::: I haven't read your book yet, but it is on my list. Do you plan to do a part 2 book for once the special counsel's investigation closes?
17:::As a native of NYC -my best guess is Giuliani was aligned to one segment of the mafia and the mafioso who  he put away were rivals to that family or group.
17:::Thanks for replying!  I feel like most of the Right's acceptance of Russia came after Trump changed the message in 2016. Nearly all of the GOP were *extremely* anti-Russian warhawks for many, many years... even using Communism as a means to scare people. It all seemed to change just before the election and yet none of them batted an eyelash at the 180º turn that seemingly happened overnight. Truly fascinating.  How can we help our fellow (blinded) Americans see the true nature of Russia's corruption and mobsters ingrained in their government? It hasn't exactly been a secret worldwide for quite some time, yet people ignore what's in front of their faces out of convenience.
17:::If secrecy had ever been a goal, they would never have used Trump. Russia didn't need an ally, they needed a bull to release in the china shop of US institutions and norms, the more public the better.   The goal of this operation was never to win over the American public and carry on business as usual; I'd argue that its dual purposes were a) to alienate the US from its historic allies and decrease American soft power, and b) erode political and legal norms that haven't been codified, thereby defanging the system of "checks and balances" which were supposed to be the bedrock of the US as a sovereign entity.   This is arcane legal territory now, and it seems more and more as if a team of hostile specialists in American constitutional law have been very delicately unraveling the threads that the government is woven from. The only end game that makes such a high stakes operation worthwhile from the perspective of a hostile government is one where the attacked nation is left too fractured to retaliate in any meaningful way. 
18:::What is Simon Mogilevich upto these days, now that Trump is president?   In your book you went into a lot of detail about the past, but the modern day picture wasn't that clear. What is the simplest path that connects the US president to the head of the Russian mob today?
18:::I'll also add that this is also a continuation of the cold war. Republicans are so heavily in bed with Russia and it's disgusting. I'm surprised how many of them are compromised, especially with how on point the CIA was at limiting Soviet influence back in the 80s when the right started selling out to the enemy
19:::Do you think Wikileaks is a Russian misinformation outlet?
19:::Keep it up. If it weren't for you and the people doing this work to shine lights into shitty places this would be a worse off world.
19:::Dude, that's fucking gross. And that's coming from someone subscribed to the sub that's nothing but snuff videos.
20:::What do you make of the deutsche bank raids this morning. It's said to be related to the panama papers, but is there a decent chance they will also scoop up anything related to trump/russia?
20:::According to a certain Russian president, there is no such thing as ex KGB.
21:::> In addition, a huge part of the country simply is not following the scandal.  Besides impeachment hearings.. what do you think it would take for the public to take more interest?  ...Or are we too consumed with entertainment and social media to even think that's a possibility? 
22:::Part of Senate investigation report : [https://www.thedailybeast.com/kremlin-used-nra-to-help-trump-in-2016-says-senate-intelligence-committee](https://www.thedailybeast.com/kremlin-used-nra-to-help-trump-in-2016-says-senate-intelligence-committee)  Maybe not the $70 million claimed but campaign finance laws make it hard to determine who and how much was exactly contributed. We know that Maria Butina was an unregistered Russian spy with strong ties to the NRA.
24:::Given Trump's alleged penchant for underage girls, do you think that any such tapes are much worse than simple Pee Tapes?
24:::Thank you. This is exactly how I’ve been feeling lately and it’s been frustrating watching everyone seemingly forget that war exists on many levels now, not only conventionally.
25:::How much of Congress do you think ends up in the final indictments?
25:::Your other book, House of Bush, House of Saud, helped a lot of people realize how close the United States government was/is to the government and rulers of Saudi Arabia.   Since the time you wrote that book, much more information has come out about the Saudi's and their various ties to 9/11.  In your opinion, do you think that they will ever be held accountable for the crimes against humanity that they help to facilitate and orchestrate? To follow this question, why have all presidents since 9/11 (both Obama and Trump), allowed the Saudi's to walk all over America/Americans without proper retaliation?  Thank you 
25:::Hi Craig! Given the sheer amount of news that's come out over the last 48 hours, do you feel as if things are escalating more quickly now with the Russia investigation? What do you think is next on the docket that the media hasn't focused on yet, or haven't paid attention to much? I feel like it's almost impossible to keep up with it all.
25:::Also, your book House of Bush, House of Saud can give great context to our relationship regarding Saudi Arabia.
25:::This is also why it was so painfully obvious to the FBI for a long, long time.   The irony is, all of these people, individually, were probably more useful to watch rather than prosecute.  But the Trump campaign literally united all of these criminal individuals and enterprises under one giant roof, making it irresistible.
26:::Will the Deutsche Bank raid likely yield anything prosecutable about Trump-related Russian money-laundering?
26:::I forgot where I saw it, and who said it, but it was in regards to humanity reaching an inflection point re: global warming, automation, and human populations. Some people are waking up to the realization that the survival of humanity will require either genocide or a massive redistribution of wealth. Some of those people have decided on genocide.
28:::In your personal opinion, is Trump a traitor or just dumb or both?
30:::Hard to predict. I think he could be forced out earlier than people think. But he is also capable of doing something horrible as a distraction and if we are plunged into war there is no telling w hat will happen.
31:::What are your views on the validity of the Steele dossier? Do you believe that guilty parties will face justice for their roles in this?
31:::[@sarahkendzior](https://twitter.com/sarahkendzior) has been saying this over and over that Trump has been compromised by the Russians since the 80's.  Edit: Here are a [bunch of her Tweets](https://twitter.com/search?l=&q=1987%20from%3Asarahkendzior&src=typd) on him meeting Russian officials in 1987
31:::Interesting. It never seemed right to me that Ivana still spoke highly of Donald after everything that happened between them. It's perhaps because they both have secrets of a business and criminal nature that supercede any personal conflict.
32:::The role of the Russian Mafia and its ties to Russian intelligence. As my book shows, they have an extraordinary history of ties to the president of the United States!
36:::Thank you for your time. In their book *Russian Roulette*, Michael Isikoff and David Corn allege that in 2013, after the infamous Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, Putin delivered Trump a black lacquered box with a sealed letter. What do you believe the contents of that letter are?
36:::With what you know and what you've seen. What's your time frame on this really? Are we in this for another 2 years? 
36:::I believe the whole Trump Russian connetiction started out as laundering $ for the Ru mob thru his real estate, but evolved into something far bigger. But Mogilevich's role today is not entirely clear to me.  Ultimately, Putin is in charge. 
38:::There will be more.
43:::Given that the Putin playbook, *Foundations of Geopolitics*, gives very clear warnings against military confrontation with the United States because of the incredible disparity in conventional power.  Is there any value to the US, or its leaders, taking a more hawkish position when it comes to Russia?  For instance should House Democrats start adding budget appropriations requiring lethal aid and intervention in Ukraine, thereby forcing Trump's hand to act against Putin.
44:::Thanks for the info. Wikipedia I read on him this morning just said he and Michael were friends and left it at that.   As if they'd met randomly on elementary playgrounds.   This makes a lot more sense they met because they were both in shady families hanging out at places shady people hung out. 
45:::Looking at previous special council investigations into Presidents, many of them go back quite a bit and beyond the actual investigation itself and bleed go into unrelated areas.  Do you see this investigation going the same way into previous Russian mafia dealings or stay focussed on the the past ten or so years. 
45:::I just trying to do my work.
47:::Is it possible that it was going on even before the 80s? Ivana got out of Communist Czechoslovakia in the 70s which was not very easy to do.
48:::Wikileaks works for Russia and I think Roger Stone's ties to it may well lead to his indictment.
48:::I was never part of the 9/11 truther movement.
50:::Do you think Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell will bear any of the responsibility for knowing Trump has been compromised with mafia activity for years and sheltering him anyway? 
50:::Let's cut to the chase, shall we?  A segment of white Americans have been convinced that the only way they can survive as the 'top' of the food chain is to undermine majority-rules democracy itself (because they believe that non-whites have seized the demographic majority). This panic is at the bottom of what's going on.
51:::It will take some time to play out, but I think as Mueller's revelations come out, as more indictments are dropped it will begin to unravel. In January, for the first time, the Dems will have a real weapon because they control congress. Subpoenas should fly and as they do, the back story will be revealed. (Much of it is in my book,)
54:::I think we may finally wean ourselves from the Saudis, but not with this administration. The US is no longer so dependent on their oil, and  with Obama at least we got an accord with Iran that began to redress the balance of power in the Middle East. That was a start--and a huge step-- but with Trump we have gone backwards.
54:::I  think Trump's blithe response to the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi suggests we all should be worried.
59:::    Imagine how it feels KNOWING those names and their significance after years of following Russia and CIS political scene, including the very tight dealings authorities have with the criminal class there, and then seeing dozens and dozens of those familiar names (and their foreign enablers like Manafort, Flynn, Sater, Cohen, Wilbur Ross) all pop up in the same place – Trump’s campaign and then admin! This is also the reasoning I use to explain to people that this is a genuine conspiracy, not a “theory” of one: conspiratorial folk tend to have an established narrative – and try to fit all the news & stories to fit it post-factum. While this was very much a collection of seemingly independent storylines (from Manafort in Ukraine to Flynn at Russia Today gala, to Sessions & Kislyak, to Tillerson and the Order of Friendship, to Trump, Cohen and the Brooklyn mafia etc), that came together into one strand, which was in plain sight but was really picked up by the MSM waaay too late, when the game was already lost.
62:::Based on how Putin historically operates, how upfront would he be with someone (e.g. Trump) about pressure he can exert and kompromat in his possession? Would he outright say "I've got this and that and I can leak it"/"I can prove Cohen is telling the truth and you and your family aren't" or would he just let it go unsaid?  In simpler terms, if Russia has something on Trump what are the chances that Trump even knows exactly what it is?
64:::Don't know who may be prosecuted re Deutsche Bank, but Russian money laundering is a huge part of this and how they compromised him. Trump was $4 billion in debt and the Russians bailed him out. They own him.
66:::Yes, it's possible. She was under surveillance by the Stb, the Czech secret police, and they reported to the KGB. I asked Genl Oleg Kalugin(ex KGB) about it, but there are many unanswered questions.
69:::Don't know who will be indicted, but a lot of Republicans are implicated. It is sometimes said that in Washington, the biggest scandal is what IS legal,a nd in this case you will find boatloads of Russian money going to the GOP--often in legal ways. The National Rifle Association got $70M from Russia, then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee got big bucks.  I'm certain I've barely scratched the surface. The big white shoe law firms--Jones Day, for examp\[le-- represent powerful Russian oligarchs who have billions and billions of dollars. Much of this is legal even though I believe it has compromised huge parts of the GOP.
69:::Trump's ties to the Russian mafia are a huge part of it and its what I write about. Americans have a hard time grasping that these mobsters are state actors, they report, ultimately, to Putin. This has extraordinary ramifications.
71:::The Democrats should take a strong position in defense of Ukraine but that does not necessarily mean military intervention. We are in a hybrid war now--war by other means, with cyber warfare, information warfare and we need to combat it that way.
75:::What was you OH SHIT this is something moment?
78:::I think they bear huge responsibility for covering for him. Whether they will be punished for it is another question.
78:::I wonder though if you can look at it from the lens, not of a spectacular victory, but of a mounting disaster.   What Putin really needed was an ally as good at the game as he was.  What he got was an exposed nerve.  In the intelligence community, spies and plants can be liabilities - they are an open channel to the people who control those spies.  That's why spies are burned or cut off if there's even a chance they were exposed.   Trump is a massive exposure.  His egregious mishandling of his entire presidency has exposed, extremely publicly, Russian machinations which would have undoubtedly never come to public light otherwise.   As you outlined, think of how long it has been widely known Trump was deeply involved with Russians, and how many Republicans took Russian money.  And no one cared.  Barely anyone wrote books about it, certainly no special counsels were established to probe and prosecute the depths of these crimes.   The FBI knew, and monitored, but only as due diligence.   Trump has upended all of that, and it seems impossible to believe that, however euphoric it was for Putin at first, that this is still the end he desired.    Instead, what will happen, in due time, I suspect, is a massive tide of furious anger both domestic and abroad towards Putin, probably around the time of 2020, provided Trump faces justice and Democrats gather more power.   Had Putin *not* put Trump in power, I think none of that would have happened.  He would have continued in the shadows, people would have continued not to care, and he could have slowly gained influence over more reliable actors like McConnell, and cemented real power.  However brilliant this gambit of Putin's appears at the outset, I think ultimately this will go down as an extraordinary blunder that effectively destroys Putin's rule in Russia and reinvigorates American liberties and causes us to reevaluate and overhaul our system of laws.
83:::Hello Craig, I have not yet read your book but am extremely eager to do so.   My question is, what, in your opinion or as your best guess, was Putin's real intention with the 2016 election?  Do you think Putin actually wanted Trump to win, or did he just want to fuel the social and political divide to create a divisive schism that would impede US interference in Russia's empirical ambitions in Europe?   It seems to me that Putin is in a worse position ultimately with Trump in office than if Clinton had won and Trump became a sort of living martyr with a megaphone, fostering huge resistance and animus to the Democratic government.   Do you think Putin was caught off guard by how clumsy and ham-fisted Trump has conducted himself in office?  And do you think Putin was surprised by Mueller's probe, and does the mandate and expansive reach and results of the Mueller probe genuinely frustrate or threaten Putin's election engineering and the money laundering efforts of his oligarchs?
86:::How long has this been going on? i.e.: when did they start actively using Trump? I can only assume that it was from the birther episode forward if not sooner. What is the endgame and has the whole thing begun to implode? Who else has been compromised, Rand Paul, Mitch OConnell, Paul Ryan etc.  
87:::It has been widely known for decades that Russia often uses videotaped  "honey traps" to compromise influential visitors and General Oleg Kalugin, former  head of counterintelligence for the KGB, told me they probably did with Trump during his visit to Russia in 1987--long before the events in the Steele dossier.  I can't tell what is inside Trump's mind, but everyone who traveled to Russia knew this.
89:::I think Trump may be forced out sooner than some people realize, but I think this is an epic scandal that is going to take a few years to unravel. We have entered a new age of kleptocracy with Russia as a Mafia state, with the Saudis dismembering journalists. There is a lot of cleaning up to do.
96:::While not everything in the dossier has been corroborated, some of it has and so far as I can tell none of it has been disproved. Steele has a terrific reputation in the intelligence world.
104:::Legal questions aside (about what is a traitor), there is no question in my mind that Trump is serving Russian interests. As to his intelligence, I think he's more like a gangster.  His lies seem idiotic at times, but a lot of the nonsense he spews is right out of the Kremlin Playbook in terms of assaulting the truth, assaulting the press. Infact, I think he has been quite effective in that regard.
106:::Yes. As my book shows, Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the FBI described Kislin as having ties tot he Russian mob. I should add, however, it made goood political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.
107:::Do you find it suspicious that while Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, that the Russian mob was allowed to thrive under his tenure in the Southern District and Mayor? And now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs?
109:::What do you think is driving the conservative folks, like in congress, to downplay all of this? Are they just that un-American? Weren't they upset over Obama's ties to a minister?  And have you interviewed any of them (even off record) about all this and what are they saying in private that they won't say in public?
111:::My book tries to deal with the events the last 35 or 40 years and show how and when this started and I think eventually it will begin to unravel. The Michael Cohen revelations today are just one thread and if you pull it, you have to ask who were Cohena nd Felix Sater dealing w in Moscow?. My book shows that Sater was dealing with Russian companies such as Mirax and Sistema and their principals are tied to Semion Mogilevich, the brains behind the Russian Mafia. As I show, Mogilevich operatives have been using Trump real estate for decades to launder money. That means Russian Mafia operatives have been part of his fortune for years, that many of them have owned condos in Trump Towers and other properties, that they were running operations out of Trump's crown jewel.    &#x200B;  One of hte most important things that is often overlooked is that the Ru Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. Russia is a mafia state. that is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States is deeply disturbing.,
160:::PoppinKreams recaps have me wondering a lot about Felix Sater and who he is.   Is he a guy who could have been on the inside the whole time? Or is he really the kind of man who would get through his previous mafia scam case and informant status, and then knowingly go get himself involved in more equally shady stuff like the Kazahks laundering and even this Trump stuff?  I guess my question is what is this guys possible motives? Money? Informant? Just likes to be involved in this kind of stuff?  He's a fascinating guy to think about even before you get to weird facts like being a childhood friend of Michael Cohen.
187:::Early on, a source told me that all this was tied to Semion Mogilevich, the powerful Russian mobster. I had never even heard of him, but I immediately went to a database that listed the owners of all properties in NY state and looked up all the Trump properties. Everytime I found a Russian sounding name, I would Google, and add Mogilevich.  When you do investigative reporting, you antiicpate drilling a number of dry holes, but almost everyone I googled turned out to be a Russian mobster. Again and again. If you known, New York, you don't expect Trump Tower to be a high crime neighborhood, but there were far too many Russian mobsters in Trump properties for it to be a coincidence.
207:::Complex question that would require several books to answer, but it's almost as if we are in a new civil war of sorts. And its worth remembering we were a nation founded on--and divided by-slavery. I trhink this scandal is reopening long festering historic wounds. In addition, a huge part of the country simply is not following the scandal. Recently returned from a cross county tour and it is very hard to reach across the aisle to Fox Nation. There is no longer a shred national narrative. The right and social media has hijacked it.
219:::Felix is one of the most enigmatic people in the whole Trump saga. We know that he has a double life--he's a convict who became a govt cooperator for the FBI and other agencies. But did he really have a triple life? Was he really working wit the Russian Mafia even though he was a govt cooperator? In addition, his longtime ties to Michael Cohen are not so much a coincidence as part of the fabric of the entire scandal. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his inlaws and his brother's in-laws. Felix's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years and my book traces all these relationships.
250:::The big surprise in my book is that I believe this has been going on for decades, that Trump was first compromised by the Russians in the  Eighties back in the days of the Soviet Union and the Cold War. In 1984, my book shows, the Russian Mafia first began to use Trump real estate to launder money and it continued for decades and may have accounted for billions of dollars flowing to Trump. My book traces the major events in that relationship for 35 years. In the 90s, the Russians began sending $ to GOP Speaker of the House Tom Delay, etc. Even in 1988, Trump, after his first trip to Russian, took out full page ads in the NYT and WaPO, etc, touting a foreign policy that was very anti-NATO. I believe most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee run by Mitch McConnell got millions from Leonard Blavatnik. Much, much more int he book. As for the endgame, I think it is already begning to unravel.
253:::There's no question Putin wanted Trump to win and I believe his overarching goal was to reduce American power and strike out against the Western Alliance. It was probably the most successful intelligence operation in recent history--he put a Russian asset in the White House without firing a single shot!  And just look, in response to Russia's attacks against Ukraine this week, what Trump does: He lashes out at NATO! In addition, Trump's assault on truth, on hte media has been enormously effective. All our elections are suspect. I think this has been a spectacular victory for Putin--which is why Mueller's work and Democratic oversight is so essential.
