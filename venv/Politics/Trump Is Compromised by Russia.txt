1:::>The project moved further along than publicly known. **A letter of intent to build the new Trump Tower was signed by the Trump Organization and Agalarov’s company. Donald Trump Jr. was placed in charge of the project. A few months later, Ivanka Trump flew to Russia and scouted sites with Emin for the new venture.** “We thought that building a Trump Tower next to an Agalarov tower—having the two big names—could be a really cool project to execute,” Emin later said.  >Trump was finally on his way in Russia. And shortly after the Miss Universe event, **Agalarov’s daughter showed up at the Miss Universe office in New York City bearing a gift for Trump from Putin. It was a black lacquered box. Inside was a sealed letter from the Russian autocrat. What the letter said has never been revealed.**  >*Isikoff, Michael. Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin's War on America and the Election of Donald Trump (p. 18). Grand Central Publishing. Kindle Edition.*
1:::*In a Jan. 11, 2017, news conference, Trump said that the “closest I came to Russia” was in selling a Palm Beach mansion to a Russian oligarch in 2008. While we’re just learning precisely how dishonest this was, Putin has known it all along. That means that throughout Trump’s campaign and presidency, Putin has had the power to plunge him into political crisis.*
1:::Hey, do you hear that? That's the sound of Trump's base not caring and putting party over country on the most tangible, inarguable terms yet. 
1:::Donald Trump, the worst traitor to the United States in our history, is going down.  Trump fans: don't ***EVER*** say you weren't warned you were being played by a con-man.
1:::Why is all of this information coming out now? I just heard that Donald Junior and Ivanka were CCed on many of the emails.  It's very hard to keep up with because there's so much coming out at once, but I wonder why now?
1:::Shit, this feels different all of a sudden. The end must be near.
1:::No shit. 
1:::>The question now is whether Senate Republicans, who could actually do something about it, will ever be moved to care.  It is not a matter of Senate Republicans *caring.*  Senate Republicans are *complicit.*  They care like a motherfucker. This is why they are doing nothing. Trump is not the only Republican wattle-deep in Russian-funded treason.
1:::What a remarkable day. Remember this one folks. Your grandkids will ask you about it one day.  
1:::It’s good to remember that this whole investigation isn’t about nailing Trump, or pinning some kind of dumb charge on him to delegitimize his presidency like most trump supporters and Trump would have you believe.   It’s to find out if trump is compromised by the Kremlin. Is he a Kremlin asset, or worse, agent? Does the Kremlin have leverage on him in the form of money laundering or kompromat?   If so, This directly interferes with his ability to lead the country, to direct our military, to have access to our intelligence, and make decisions in the countries best interest. And trump, so far, has acted like he’s been compromised, with waffling regarding Russian sanctions, to attacking our law enforcement and intelligence apparatus, to standing on a stage with Putin and taking his side over our intelligence agencies. There’s no other explanation.   I always respect how whenever Mueller acts, all of the gaslighting and fog generated from the Trump and fox noise machines just evaporates, and cuts into what this is really all about. 
1:::Why is this in the opinion section?  Kind of seriously though; with the Revelations that came out today, can't a publication just report this as fact?
1:::went to see how the Donald was taking it.   "perfectly legal meetings"   okay then....
1:::He should have been arrested during the campaign when he SOLICITED Russia to hack Hillary's emails.  Whether he would have been convicted, maybe not, but is should have been clear this kind of treason was unacceptable.
1:::I'll be excited when this is a real NYT article, not an opinion piece.
1:::EVERYONE  I recommend going to the r/Conservative sub today. Olympic level mental gymnastics!
1:::Remember when Bill Clinton lied about a blow job and that was the worst thing that could possibly happen to America. Man that was so tame. This guy is well known for cheating on his wives with prostitutes and porn stars as well as generally being abusive and disgusting towards women yet those same people that were so outraged seem to not give a fuck about anything. 
1:::We’ve noticed.
1:::I cannot *wait* to see when bombshell headlines like these can be posted on the cover of the NYT instead of solely limited to the Op-Ed section.
1:::> He also “briefed family members of Individual 1 within the company about the project.”  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-russia-steve-bannon-michael-wolff  Bannon: ‘They’re going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV
1:::[Welcome to 1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_projects_of_Donald_Trump_in_Russia)
1:::Looks like trump may be manafucked as well.
1:::How my brain imagines it went down:  *Mueller could have gotten this testimony either from Manafort OR Cohen.  *Mueller screams and threatens for a while, neither Manafort nor Cohen budge.  *Mueller says fine.  *Sends Manafort to jail for the rest of his natural life.  *Confiscates everything Manafort owns.  *"Ok, now how about you?" he says to Cohen.  *Cohen shits himself and starts singing like a canary.
1:::I just can't get over the irony that Trump supporters love spreading conspiracy theories about people or things they disagree with, but can't see the actual conspiracy between Trump and Russia glaring them in the face. Guess that's why Trump loves the poorly educated. 
1:::I love how he builds $50 million dollar penthouses for Russians while he leaves American GM workers in the dust  Reminds me of his Trump "university" scam where he scammed his followers out of all their money with a fake university
1:::Conservatives are the party of trump, at least on Reddit, if you don't think so post anything anti Trump on r/conservative and get a ban.   They protect their safe space and project. When that big orange clown fart gets publicly humiliated I will never let anyone I know who supported him forget what a piece of shit they supported despite all warnings.
1:::As more and more news comes out and we near the end game, never forget those who supported and enabled Trump. They'll be the same ones screaming bloody murder and be outraged 24/7 over the smallest and dumbest shit when an actual adult Democrat takes over the Presidency.  Many of them are denialists not arguing in good faith. They'll move onto to the next thing and just continue to distort and gaslight.  They don't have any real values or beliefs other than a desperate thirst for power.
1:::Andddd Saudi Arabia 
1:::Sherlock?
1:::This was well known prior Election Day. Hillary was saying this shit from campaigning days.
1:::God damn right he is. That's the problem with having a business man as President. Republicans made Jimmy Carter give up his peanut farm. Republicans, seriously get your shit together. 
1:::Don't care if there's a pee tape or he eats his own shit tbh. He makes the world a worse place so fuck him 
1:::So ummmm, are they actually going to do something about it or just talk about it.  
1:::>Nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption. These most deadly adversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than one querter, but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils. How could they better gratify this, than by raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the Union?    Alexander Hamilton, [the Federalist Papers No. 68](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp)
1:::I'm shocked. /s
1:::All the trolls have to respond is "look at the source, obviously tabloid rumor..."  Good luck with that jajajaja
1:::Well... yeah.
1:::   “I think he is definitely compromised," Cohen said on Hill.TV's "Rising" after being asked by co-host Krystal Ball if he thinks Trump is an enemy of the state. "I think he has certain financial interests, probably through Deutsche Bank, and the Russians own him and his family.”  “I also think they have compromising material on him when he was in Moscow during the Miss Universe contest,” Cohen added.
1:::The whole GOP is compromised.  If it wasn't, Trump wouldn't have been their nominee in the first place.
1:::Once again, we been knew. Thanks for finally catching up to where we all were a year ago, NYT. 
1:::Will the Trump pee tape be shown in the same scope and scale as the first episode of Black Mirror?
1:::Probably since the 1980s.
1:::This is why they cancelled the meeting, I bet; the bajllions of news organizations reaching out for quotes about this crap.  Even these orange clowns can recognize a bad day happening, sometimes.
1:::No shit.
1:::Yes we know and we knew it even before he was elected. The question is what's next. 
1:::can i request an op-ed flair for posts?
1:::It’s very 2018 that some jackass would just about bring about Earth Armageddon for condos.
1:::Trump is the worst
1:::We've known this for years. But the GOP is complicit and his cult just want to make liberals smell their shit.
1:::Message to mods: Why do we not tag opinion articles as such in this sub?   edit: Didn't realize this would be such a controversial topic...
1:::Vladimir Trump indeed! 
1:::"Trump is compromised..." seems like a very obvious statement.
1:::Even if we could conclusively prove it beyond all shadow of doubt, sadly, there are millions of Americans who still wouldn't care.  Sad state of affairs of politics in America.
1:::This is so depressing... Hillary WARNED us back in 2016, as did many others, but millions were too stupid to realize it. I'm sorry, but this is frankly infuriating. We could have an intelligent, functioning, non treasonous president right now if half our populace wasn't so stupid. I have little doubt that as soon as a democratic president is in office, the GOP is gonna forget everything and go back to hypocritically complaining about everything, like travel expenses. 
1:::You know, people always comment "surely this is it for Drumpf" but I honestly think this time they might be right.
1:::Trump is Russia's useful idiot...  They got him out of desperate financial trouble, they helped his businesses grow with dirty money, and then they helped him win the election by engaging in cyberwarfare against America.  Fucking incredible, it really is. And Russia could care less of the negative consequences this has on there old US Cold War rival. 
1:::I thought this was common knowledge by now?
1:::It's the worst-kept secret ever.
1:::Gee, ya think?  Some of us have been banging this drum for years.  My family used to joke about Trump being "Russian mob" material *years before he openly considered running for office* due to his real estate flops, casino deals and debt that no U.S. Bank would touch.
1:::Please let this all be over. I’m so tired of having to care about this jerk.
1:::We know these truths to be self evident

1:::In other news, water is wet
1:::Water is wet.
1:::Putin is by far the most powerful person in the world and he's kicking our asses.  This needs to end.
1:::Donald trump is a traitor. The sad part is idiots elected him knowing this
1:::The republicans are consistently moving the goal post and ratcheting down on more extreme tactics to cheat. Why would they all of a sudden have an epiphany and call Trump out when half of them are Gerrymandering and cleaning voters from the registries and racist robocalling all to make it into office and enrich themselves and horde. The USA is a decaying cesspool fizzling out the last few bubbles of post war imperialist winner's advantage. Unlike World War 2...there is no great super power to save the world from the 3 largest militaries at present (USA, China, Russia) and they are currently being ran by authoritarians. They have tricked the populations into being slaves to their own digitized vanity. Now we huddle around the pixel confirmation bias signals in our own virtual tribe bubbles. Put on all black the next time there is resistance on display in your area and go do something to feel alive. They are just going to keep throwing you down the stairs...until your dollars are worthless.
1:::b-but  but whatabout obama did the one thing  muh uranium twennypursent
1:::I think it might even be simpler than the penthouse and bring compromised etc.  How much would it take to buy Trump?   Like literally have him do what you ask for a few years?   I think 5 billion would do it.   I just don't see any evidence Trump would refuse it.   Trump has no pride in America and doesnt even respect his own country.   So when you see Trump smiling at Putin, its because he's happy about the deal.  He's not upset about being blackmailed.  General directions like fight the brown people, cut taxes on the rich, complain about the media being against you is all it would take.  Putin could be giving these to Trump in their unrecorded meetings. 
1:::Been so crazy today I forgot to flip on FOX News to see if they were still talking about Andrew McCabe text messages
1:::Big headline considering the source.
1:::He's been a *de facto* Russian agent since he was running for the Republican nomination.
1:::Good on the New York Times for telling it like it is. 
1:::What is it with news outlets stating the obvious so much the past couple of years? 
1:::Are you fucking kidding me? They're not even using cutouts or dead drops? This is painful.
1:::>A letter of intent to build the new Trump Tower was signed by the Trump Organization and Agalarov’s company.  Oh hey [check out this photo of Rotem Rosen with Aras Agalarov, Donald Trump, and Alex Sapir at the Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow in 2013](https://imgur.com/a/woV8rK1).  Rotem Rosen... that name rings a bell. Wait, is that the same Rotem Rosen that was photographed with Michael Cohen at the famous sidewalk cigar scene? [Yep, that's him in the blue suit.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DasRQ5eV4AA0oJF.jpg) Oh, and he's [the son of a Russian oligarch who forms a direct connection between Putin and Trump?](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/the-happy-go-lucky-jewish-group-that-connects-trump-and-putin-215007) Weird.  Hey who's that in the back there wearing a grey suit? Because it sure looks like [Jerry Rotonda, former Deutsche Bank exec in charge of the American wealth management division.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/15/michael-cohen-associate-jerry-rotonda-accused-of-making-racist-threats-1998).  >Though it is unclear whether Rotonda had any direct involvement in business deals with Trump, Deutsche Bank has backed Trump development projects. **Deutsche Bank lent the Trump Organization more than $300 million for real estate transactions before Trump became president**, ABC News has previously reported. The bank helped finance a number of Trump’s high-profile developments, including the renovation of the Old Post Office in Washington, the purchase of the Doral golf course in Florida and the construction of an office building in Chicago.  >In December of 2017, ABC News reported that the special counsel Robert Mueller had sent a subpoena to Deutsche seeking records.  Is that the same Deutsche Bank that was [fined $660 million for laundering Russian oligarch money](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/31/deutsche-bank-fined-630m-over-russia-money-laundering-claims)?

I mean, [it's not like Deutsche Bank was raided *again* in the course of an investigation into money-laundering... right?](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/business/deutsche-bank-money-laundering-raid.html) Wait, that happened today?   Surely this is all one big coincidence.
1:::> It was a black lacquered box.   Literally black mail.
1:::Actual contents of letter from Putin to Trump:  >Do you like me?? Check yes or no.
1:::If it look like shit, smells like shit, and you caught the dog in the act of taking the shit, it's shit.  **It's time to bury all these piles of shit.** 
1:::Feels like a link to Emin's music video is needed here:  https://youtu.be/8cs4tKdiiI4
1:::An unlabeled video cassette. 
1:::Cohen knows. 
1:::Great book
1:::Seth Abramson has been singing this from the rafters for a year or so  What a shame the larger media organisations failed to do basic due diligence about a compromised con man who's gritting was there for all to see over a 30 year period
1:::Argalov's daughter showed up with the gift to be given in public to Trump... why do I get a feeling that was part of the kompromat and it was no accident who they chose to send it?
1:::I cannot wait for this fucking movie. Wow
1:::Yep. It's the same reason that Sally Yates sounded the alarm about Flynn.   The fact that Putin had evidence that he was lying about the phone calls was enough to compromise him, even if by chance he hadn't actually done anything wrong.   The same is true for Trump but to a much higher degree of severity.   Regardless of if Putin had kompromat on Trump before his Presidency started, which he did, Trump helpfully created new kompromat for Putin on a constant basis.   The vicious circle of Trump lying continued to dig him deeper into Putin's debt. 
1:::The urination tape all by itself would end any politician.  But at this point if it was released tomorrow I don't completely know that it even would. :/
1:::I'd like a video that starts with those clips of Trump saying that he and his campaign have nothing at all to do with Russia, and then news clips of Flynn and Stone's connections to Russia, and then Trump saying that he had almost nothing to do with Russia - no collusion, and then his personal connections, and so on.  Just really laying out all the lies and proof of the long history of conspiracy.
1:::This is the key. Putin has blackmailed Trump since the beginning
1:::Doesn’t be mean a hundred condos to Russian oligarchs?
1:::That’s true but his base will never budge. I care a lot more about what the justice system, Robert Mueller and his team of prosecutorial assassins think about all the evidence. 
1:::It's unfathomable how people who profess to love their country so much can be so indifferent to its values and interests.
1:::[removed]
1:::I have now doubt that as soon as a Democratic President is back in office the right will once again be full of moral outrage and freaking out about the debt. Shameless liars the lot of them.
1:::They won't. They'll never ever admit it. Once the ball drops and Trump is fucked, they'll just disappear and turn silent and, if confronted, deny that they ever seriously supported Trump.      The bigger issue with this Trump scandal is what happens if an actually smart and capable version of Trump with the same lackadaisical charisma comes by. We now know there are at least 55 million morons who will support him no matter what (until Fox tells them not to).       In such a case the US is really screwed
1:::>Trump fans: don't ***EVER*** say you weren't warned you were being played by a con-man.  I don't think his cultists will ever own up to anything. Even if Trump winds up being taken away in handcuffs and locked away forever - he's always going to be the victim of an evil liberal deep state to them. He can't do anything wrong because nothing is worse than the black president.
1:::> Trump fans: don't EVER say you weren't warned you were being played by a con-man  Their idol is someone who is notorious for never taking personal accountability for mistakes or errors. Won't be surprised if apologists follow his example. 
1:::Remember Nixon had a 30% approval rating when he left office. We aren’t going to turn Trump supporters. They will claim this article is just fake news. 
1:::I know it is usually in poor taste to generalize, but..... Republicans believe many illogical things, so it isn’t surprising that they are so easily played by the idiot, Donald Trump. Like likes like. 
1:::But how could they have known? (Besides based off of all of his business dealings and everything he's ever done/said/written/tweeted and all the people he's associated with)
1:::Serious question: can’t he just pardon everyone and that’s the end of it all? House votes to impeach and spineless Senate does nothing and we’re back at square one with his base eating it up.
1:::I’m not convinced anymore they were played. I mean really what happened is they don’t care about facts, they do what they’re told and the shittier things get the more they dig in their heels. 
1:::Yea but telling them they were being conned is the reason why trump won! /s
1:::It literally reads like a b movie action script from the 80s. The entire sordid story is surreal. 
1:::This should disqualify republicans from ever having a platform.
1:::Trump fans won’t stop being trump fans 
1:::Worser than E. Lee or Benedict Arnold?
1:::i said the same thing in /r/republican under another alias and received so many hate PMs that i had to logon to another account
1:::"Wow, was I wrong" - no Trump supporter ever
1:::  >Trump fans: don't EVER say you weren't warned you were being played by a con-man.  Yeah, there's no danger of that being admitted. They will die on their deathbeds blaming Obamacare of the disease killing them before they realize they've been duped by a traitorous piece of shit.   
1:::America owes Hillary Clinton a giant fucking apology. 
1:::All relevant headlines currently on foxnews.com are contained here:  https://imgur.com/OTsjk9t  Trump fans have no reason to think anything has changed, look what their source of information is telling them.  
1:::Hillary literally said this. 
1:::There are DoJ guidelines on how a federal investigation can act around elections or midterms to avoid the appearance of influencing them. Midterms are over. All this was planned out and can be set in motion finally.
1:::If Trump/Pence gets pushed out of office between now and Jan 2nd, that's President Hatch.  If it happens on Jan 3rd or later, that's President Pelosi.
1:::It really does. It feels like the dam has been broken. But I don't quite understand how. I mean, I feel like lots of things have changed but I can't really describe it.
1:::This is probably just the beginning of the true shit show. Everything so far has just been teasers and trailers.
1:::It's not. They are still interviewing/charging Cohen from the raid that feels like eons ago. They will spend the same, if not more time, on the evidence and targets acquired today. We are likely still in for a long ride.
1:::I've noticed a strange phenomena in my thinking, where it feels like news comes out and everybody learns about it when the story breaks... it's hard for me to reconcile that **Trump, Ivanka, Cohen, Stone, et. al have known every piece of the puzzle this entire time.**  Like, this whole time that information has slowly been trickling out, the Trump team is just sitting there KNOWING the full story, waiting for everybody else to put the puzzle pieces together. And they're still managing to leave the house and CONTINUE to fuck up and pile shit on... instead of walking on egg shells. It's crazy.
1:::For real. The President is a Russian asset/agent.
1:::This is a crucial time because it is direct proof rather than circumstance and speculation. Mueller swung hard today. This feels like a turning point.
1:::In other news; we point out water is wet, the sky is blue and Eric is still trying to get love from his father.
1:::yup. we knew this over two years ago. 
1:::They needed to say it louder for the people in the back
1:::This headline could easily have been written in 2016.
1:::Yep.  Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) Senator Richard Shelby (R-Alabama) Senator Steve Daines (R-Montana) Senator John Thune (R-South Dakota) Senator John Kennedy (R-Louisiana) Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) Senator John Hoeven (R-North Dakota)  1 in 7 Republican senators spent the last 4th of July in Moscow.  And McConnell was briefed about Russian interference by the Obama admin, in 2016 before the election. He convinced Obama to keep it secret, by threatening to discredit actionable intelligence as partisan fearmongering.  And Lindsay Graham has been acting awfully nervous lately. Right around the time he started acting awfully pro-Russia.  Those are just the obvious ones. There will be more.
1:::I've been asking the same question.  If trump stood up tomorrow and shot Miller dead, if the Senate refused to impeach, could anything be done.  I know the Democrats has house control now and they now can investigate and subpoena etc but if the Senate refuses to do anything with those results, even if they are a fresh 100% proven smoking gun, what's the next step?  The people and system that are supposed to be checks and balances are refusing to check or balance anything.  Is there another option?  
1:::Let’s not forget the good American patriot Republicans that spent the Fourth of July in Russia this year. They definitely care.
1:::Everyone who took NRA money is complicit. Including some Democrats.  Right after it came out that the Russians were giving money to political organizations our faithful politicians immediately outlawed disclosing the source of the funds. This bill went through Congress within hours. They were in a big hurry. This was just a couple months ago.  Just look to see who voted for that and you’ll have a list of complicit politicians.
1:::Why don't people remember the day when Trump went on national TV during the campaign and solicited our enemy to commit a felony against his opponent?
1:::I have a feeling they'll be a lot more interested in hearing stories about what it was like to live with bugs, elephants and snow than hearing about our failure of a president.
1:::Imagine Trump supporters grandkids asking them about this day and they have to pretend they weren’t oblivious and totally still waiting for Hillary to be the one arrested   
1:::I imagine this entire era will blend together, rather than one that will blend in the history books. The day they’ll ask about will be the day he leaves office. 
1:::I'll tell them I was pressing the F5 key on Reddit all day.
1:::Can I borrow someone's grand kids? I need to tell some young people how I witnessed the sinking of an American traitor.
1:::I don’t think Trump has either the brains or the discretion to be a Russian agent. However, I do believe that he has accepted loans/money from Russia and that he has laundered money. Now how far that takes us I don’t know.
1:::Yeah no kidding. Especially after everything the NYT did to fuck over Hillary before the election.   Edit: 😭 thanks for my first gold, stranger!
1:::Because "everyone knows this is true" and "this has been proven to be true" are very different things, and NYTimes still mostly knows the difference.    Reporting things as fact just because you're pretty sure it's true is kinda why were in this mess
1:::I just stopped going there. Every time there was a bit of Trump news where I thought "SURELY they will acknowledge this!" Nope. Something else or someone else is going on, everything is 100% ok.   I feel like at this point Trump could be caught with his literal pants down with Putin reaching for the lube and the reply would be " this doesn't show anything, fake news. Man is allowed his privacy"
1:::Fuck no, can you imagine the optics of Obama’s government arresting the Republican candidate for president?
1:::Remind me! 5 months 
1:::From the Wikipedia page linked above.   “In 1987, Trump visited Russia to investigate developing a hotel, invited by Ambassador Yuri Dubinin whom he had met in New York the year before. British journalist Luke Harding alleged in 2017 that this trip likely began a long-term cultivation operation typical of the KGB's Political Intelligence Department, under written directives initiated by First Chief Directorate head Vladimir Kryuchkov, to recruit politically ambitious Westerners susceptible to flattery, egotism and greed.”
1:::MTG players prefer manascrewed but your term will work in a pinch
1:::As much as i hate Trump, i agree w this. Opinion articles should always be tagged. 
1:::Great question!
1:::Because this is politics, not news. The sub is basically for opinion pieces.  That would be like requiring a “Lies” tag in TD. People just know what the subs are for.
1:::It's absurd really. They love to blast headlines on the front page, almost always op-ed. Quite literally "fake news" if you think about it.
1:::It's an op-ed.
1:::You're like a snarky PoppinKREAM. I like you. 
1:::I'm gonna need more red yarn
1:::Thank you for the write up.
1:::Holy shit god damn is this a good comment. These traitorous fucks are going down right before our eyes.   Get a Democratic House, investigate anything and everything that needs to be investigated, find irrefutable proof of wrongdoing that absolutely cannot be denied or swept under the rug, and get our country back on track again.   Edit: We know the evidence exists. This isn’t a conspiracy theory. Proof of so much wrongdoing is right in front of us. We need the Special Counsel’s findings, combined with a house that will present the information faithfully to the public. At that point, if we still haven’t fixed this fucking problem, then we have completely failed as a nation.
1:::I nominate Quentin Tarantino to direct the documentary on this. Title: Mango in Chains
1:::*slaps top of box*  "This baby can fit so much fucking kompromat in it!"
1:::he put so much damn lacquer on that thing
1:::So just like when all those congressmen went to Russia on Independence day, that symbolism was intentional.     Both the DNC and RNC were hacked. The dirt on the DNC cost them the election. The dirt on the RNC is how all these Republicans are compromised including Don Cheeto. 
1:::And black boxes also hold the end of a lot of lives.
1:::Black mail, for lacquered a better term
1:::As Trump flames out and crashes to the ground it’s always important to recover the Black Box. 
1:::What kind of comic universe are we living in? 
1:::And then this pussy shit "president" sold out the god damn country even more to try to save his ass, because he was still to stupid to realize he was fucked.   He was literally delivered black mail from Putin and still thought he'd be able to get out without being caught. I really do hope this moron goes down for treason and is executed. He knowingly sold out his country over and over.

1:::>Actual contents of letter from Putin to Trump: > >>Do you like me?? Check yes.  Ftfy
1:::more like: ay bby, want sum treason?
1:::Yes / Definitely / absolutely. It was rigged
1:::I cannot stop laughing at your comment!!
1:::Sometimes I think it’d be fun to be an oligarch. Y’know, putting aside morality and all.
1:::What the fuck am I seeing? Is this a brag track or him trying to distance himself? 
1:::I seriously thought you had shortened Eminem to Emin, and the beginning of the song made sense for an Eminem video until the singing started.
1:::I sweat to god if this is true it will be the greatest third act reveal ever.
1:::Here's a hell of a thread about this whole mess.  https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1064726398307315712.html
1:::Could you imagine if we had a pro-America senate?  They could just tell the POS in the white house they'll approve anyone he nominates as long as it's Sally Yates.
1:::Putin is probably the kind of guy that, once trump is in the care of law enforcement officials, and he’s of no use to Putin, Putin would “leak” the Kompromat just to embarrass trump and the US. 
1:::I miss Sally Yates. I wonder if we’d ever get to see her in an AG/deputy position again?
1:::Hence why Putin smiles whenever he sees his useful idiot grinning back at him
1:::INB4 "it was [therapy for my bone spurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine_therapy)"  Edit:  thanks for the silver, kind stranger!  and yeah ... super weird.
1:::It's not just the pee-pee part of the tape, I bet anything they were underage.
1:::Until Trump.  Trump can get away with stealing a purple heart, with openly shitting on vets, with calling for violence against the other party (paying legal bills of those who run over protesters), standing behind KKK types etc.  At this point the right is so far gone, and Trump's outrages have become so incredibly outrageous, that the pee tape is nothing.
1:::We now have obstruction, financial crimes and hacking of a political opponent . Sex crime is next. Pee tape here we come
1:::He totally uses the N word on that tape, repeatedly. 
1:::His approval rating would probably improve among diehard Republicans...
1:::All it needs to do is kill his support among independents and he loses office. Anybody who supports him is a lost cause. Anybody who sees him as he is would NEVER vote for him anyway.   To win, you have to get through to the chunk of the electorate that's too stupid to see how bad he is. Swing voters are politically stupid, but they're not politically evil like partisan R's are. Change their votes and you win.
1:::Hell, Fox tried to bring down Obama with the tan suit scandal
1:::What if the pee tapes are a made up distraction and what the russians really have on him is human trafficing.  You know like through his modelling agencies, his pageants, his buddy Epstein.  He was so eager to separate parents from their children and right now many of those children are unaccounted for.  
1:::Reminder — because it always seems to be needed — that the “pee incident” everyone talks about was not a sex act. According to the story, Trump watched and laughed while some people urinated *on a bed the Obamas had slept on.*  This is not — as far as I know — a “golden showers” perversion thing. (And honestly, if it *were* that, I would be pushing for people to ignore it. I’m no kink shamer.)  Instead, it’s a petty, childish, mindless *hatred* thing, which is far worse IMO.  Also, no. Neither type of “urination tape” would be likely to “ruin” Trump. If you think so, you haven’t been paying attention.
1:::The pee tape is real at this point isn’t it. It’s so audacious that there must be *something* to it. I can’t imagine Steele was just like, “oy, fuck it, *everything* else is good let’s throw in some urination for fun.” 
1:::Oh buddy, we’ve got a whole Trump Cinematic Universe coming. Don’t you worry. There’s no way we don’t get literally a billion films and TV shows out of the most fascinating real life political thriller in history 
1:::Yeh I would like that too. Just for posterity when he is asked by another soft-ass journalist and contradicts himself once again.
1:::They honestly won’t know. Swing on by Fox News and Breitbart and the Sinclair and the Sports section of whatever local news they watch - a lot of Trump supporters really aren’t seeing these stories. 
1:::i was a trump supporter for quite some time actually. it just got to the point where i couldn’t stop lookin past everything that he was doing and all the shit surrounding him. i really did want him to do well but he’s not
1:::He can pardon himself and everyone involved, and the current SCOTUS will back him.  Our best hope for "justice" is, should the evidence play out like it looks like it's going to, is state crime charges which will be effective but wholly unsatisfying.  Having his base turn on him would be better than making him a "martyr of the deep state and MSM" behind bars IMHO.  
1:::These are not critical thinkers. They are faith-based thinkers. 
1:::And the Democratic president will get the debt under control. Like they always do.
1:::I think many liberals forgot that the Confederacy / old south never actually disappeared. It just begrudgingly shut the fuck up and half evolved into the Republican party.   But *that's* ultimately who this fight is with. The civil war never truly ended it just lay dormant. But we all know who'll win again. We just have to keep an eye on them next time.
1:::I'm not going to lie it's going to be hard to not punch a lot of people I know right in the fucking face at that point.
1:::Of course they will. It’s their natural state. It’s whatever they choose to fixate on next, with unsubstantiated claims and false evidence. They pick what matches they’re natural disposition, because it’s easier than actual being aware of the goings-on around them. Having to process complex dynamic processes makes them feel inadequate, so they lash out against what they don’t understand, like a caveman seeing fire for the first time. Oddly enough they still make the same grunting noises as their previous ancestors, so I guess some old habits really do die hard.
1:::But just think. For the rest of your life you will be able to throw Trump in the face of everyone who supported him.  10 years from now my dad is going to winging about lying dems and I'll still be able to say he doesn't give a shit about lying. He supported Trump.
1:::At least we'll have a giant example of their poor judgement to back us when we tell the fake patriots to shut the fuck up. I can't wait to tell them they don't deserve a seat at the table with the adults, and to go to their room and think about what they've done.
1:::And tan suits.
1:::Makes me think a technocracy is inevitable and potentially preferable to our democracy when so many people can be so easily duped.  This is not what Jefferson intended - and with the internet-driven hyperreality problem, I'm not sure we'll ever realize his dream of an educated electorate and maximal personal liberty...
1:::They will. They're even trying it right now. 
1:::That's why I'm taking lots of screenshots of social media now. I'll get them made into posters and carry them along to get togethers. I am petty and they will not be allowed to hide.
1:::That is the exact thing they did with W, everyone on /conservative were anti-W, at least according to them. It got so bad that the Iraq war was blamed on Clinton in 2016!
1:::Time to Godwin's Law y'all motherfuckers. That's exactly what happened after Hitler for the most part. Most of them immediately went silent and blended back in with the rest of society. I think Trump supporters will be more vocal though if he is ever removed from office. They'll maintain it was worth it to not have Hillary and he'll still be their God Emperor.
1:::We just need to really not allow them to forget or. We should have had enough of the bullying and gaslighting from the right wing media for the past 30 years
1:::In ten years you won't able to find 5 people in a packed room who admit voting trump.  The human brain will make them forget because cognitive dissonance causes real pain 
1:::We need to gain sufficient majorities to pass a slew of constitutional amendments addressing voting rights, pardon power, firearms, white-collar crime, inheritance taxes, etc.
1:::Maybe that's an optimists view. In this age of disinformation and fake news, a large slice of the Fox crowd will probably think that Hillary and the ~Deep state~ brought down a president. They're that far gone.
1:::Theyll say there was no way to really know until it was too late...
1:::I don't know. He's such a cult of personality for these people, they may double down. It's all fake news. The dems planted the evidence, Soros funded it, the Obamas and Clintons are involved, etc. I can see that happening for sure.
1:::When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island, I 'magine you're gonna take off that handsome-lookin' S.S. uniform of yours, ain'tcha?... That's what I thought. Now that I can't abide.  I mean, if I had my way... you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-suckin' life.
1:::I really think there’s some serious disconnect between you and any Trump supporter. I was a pretty big Trump supporter up until the first six months or so of his presidency, but I learned he was being pretty mediocre. He couldn’t even deliver on most of his own “promises” and nothing was getting done at all. I am now royally pissed off because yeah, I can admit I was very wrong in thinking it was just a conspiracy theory. Surely you can see that right? Like who wants to even consider the fact that a foreign country meddled in their election and has had an arm in our (not so) sovereign government for the past 2 ish years? But yeah, not everyone who initially loved Trump is just some stupid hick who watches Fox News. I can fully admit that I was spectacularly wrong, and that I was a fool to trust this man.
1:::What's more scary is that the Trump supporters I know won't even deny their support, they'll just refuse he's done nothing wrong even if he's convicted. It's like a fucking cult. 
1:::Tbh I think we got lucky. Imagine if Trump wasn't such a ass. That would've been complete mayhem
1:::That is best case scenario. My guess is we are 2 years away from a Fox News host yelling at the camera about how Donald Trump was actually  a secret liberal plot to destroy America. I mean, Glenn Beck was denouncing George W Bush as a progressive...in 2009...and their audience didn't even blink, despite the fact that they had just voted for the dude 5 years before specifically and exclusively because he was decidedly not a progressive. So yeah, really looking forward to Tucker Carlson dismissing Nikki Haley as part of the Trumpian-globalist-open-border wing of the Republican Party in 2021.
1:::> We now know there are at least 55 million morons who will support him no matter what (until Fox tells them not to).  A good chunk of those votes were pure hate anti-Hilary votes. If the DNC could learn a thing or two and not fuck it up next time, I don't know that the 55 million will all vote for the same person again; no matter how Trump-esque.
1:::They were calling him the *antichrist*, after all.
1:::Reagan and HW Bush were prominent Nixon defenders during Watergate.  Look around at whose defending Trump. One of them will be the next republican president. 
1:::Hey now I’m not a Republican but it’s unbelievable the amount of illogical crap the “left” believes. I actually think we should stop calling most people who fully support the democratic party as it is now the left and start labeling those people that are okay with how things are being run (and have been run since Bill Clinton and Obama) as supporters of Centrists to moderate Republican policies. Because that party is nothing but neoliberal politics since the 90s. And if Pelosi is speaker she’s going to continue to support that status quo which will be okay lending support socially and with platitudes but will be vacant economically 
1:::He can but there are state crimes to deal with as well as many other politically devastating events procedures. His presidency will be effectively over
1:::Well it was that but mostly Trump turning in his take home test with lies that match the Manafort and Cohen lies  He’s fucked and unlocked Pandora’s box
1:::But like, the midterms we're almost a month ago. I guess I just don't completely understand the timeline. I don't have to, but I feel like it should make sense on some level.
1:::I’m convinced they will get Ryan in there before they oust Trump. I think Trump will become ‘ill’ and have to step down, Pence will take over and nominate Ryan for VP before it can go much further. Then there will be a lot of how we need to forgive and look to the future, and how Dems are just being mean to the Trumps while Donald is so ill. 
1:::I haven't heard anything that makes me think Pence would go down with Trump
1:::1) midterm elections are over  2) Trump submitted his answers to Mueller’s questions  Mueller’s team has had a lot of this stuff lined up for a long time I bet. They’ve known all along what the truthful answers are for the questions they sent to Trump. Now, they can act without breaking DoJ policy around elections and can execute their next moves now that they have Trump on the record. If they acted sooner, they could have had ugly PR optics or lawsuits to deal with by people claiming they were trying to influence the election, and could have forced Trump into giving them different answers. 
1:::It's because we're not learning anything *new.* We're just getting verification of what everyone has known for the last 2 years, but hasn't been able to say with certainty.   It's a hollow victory because it feels like all of this was known with enough reporting before the election, which would've prevented so much of this horrible presidency. 
1:::My non political friends are talking about all of this now- so something changed today. It might be harder for those of us who study this shit to see- but I think Cohen directly admitting to lying to Congress and conspiring with the Russians somehow broke the spell.   I think a bunch of papers just got permission to dump the stories they’ve been hanging on to also. 
1:::I feel like it's a public trial now.
1:::It's [Mueller Time.](https://twitter.com/chunkled/status/1068137230370308096)
1:::So this is basically the 30-60 day marketing push before the release date. We’re getting the trailer to the fall of the Trump “presidency” before we get the trailer to Avengers 4 LOL. Wow. 
1:::They don't know the whole story because there is no one whole story.  Does Ivanka know about Flynn's crazy-ass scheme to sell nuclear reactors to all the despots in the Middle East? Does Cohen know about Erik Prince and his plan to be Viceroy of Afghanistan? Cambridge Analytica, Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and the Mercers all originally came from Ted Cruz's campaign. Paul Manafort has a whole entire saga of crimes independent of Trumpworld.  And Russia had multiple fishing lines in the water: Carter Page, Papadapolous, WikiLeaks, Butina and Trump are all separate espionage plots.  It's not one conspiracy but like dozens of hustles and crimes all orbiting around the 2016 Trump campaign. It's a Star Wars Cantina of dirtbags pulled together by the election. Nobody knows everything.
1:::It is the sistema.  No one in trumps orbit is sure how powerful they or anyone else is. And they are all fucking around independently as well.
1:::It blows my mind as well how they're just going about their grifting business. I guess when you're that level of fucked you may as well keep on doing what you've been doing until the hammer comes down.
1:::It's not what you know; it's what you can prove.  I'm getting my popcorn ready.
1:::The President is a Russian ass. 
1:::Very wet from the perspective of water.  And quite small compared to the sky

1:::I remember that one. I remember the one where he went on national TV after the inauguration and said he obstructed justice on purpose too.   For some reason the one that has always stuck out the most to me though is the time he went on national TV and talked about his dick size and fucking porn starts in front of a large group of Boy Scouts. 
1:::That clip is going to be one that your kids watch in History class one day.    "Russia, if you're listening..."   
1:::Russia, if you're listening... Lordy I hope there are tapes. Whoa! It was on TV. There are tapes. 
1:::When that happened my jaw dropped so hard it nearly fell off and rolled down the street. I thought that would be the end of him. Then I thought it would be the end of him every day since with each new surreal and insane event that unfolds. Please let it be over soon. Make politics boring again!
1:::The one I’ll always remember is pussy tape day. That day I realized he was unforgivable.
1:::oh jesus... but, yeah.....agreed.
1:::If there are no bugs there won't be any kids to ask that question. 
1:::It's going to be frustrating to watch Republicans try to distance themselves from this train wreck when it all comes crashing down. We should never forget how the GOP enabled him. 
1:::They will be asking about the mini sub that took him to Russia.
1:::There is zero doubt that Trump had been laundering Russian money since the 80s.  Zero.  He sold real estate back in the day as part of some shady deals and people actually got caught and convicted.  To be surprised and clutch pearls like the news organizations do at this prospect is fucking insane to me.  What's happening to the world. I get stopped by a cop doing 3 over in the school zone and my life is ruined for the next 3 weeks, and this motherfucker can funnel billions of hacked up Soviet fortunes and become the president because people don't give a fuck. God damn. 
1:::I believe the term you both are looking for is "puppet".
1:::Can you imagine the optics of electing a Russian asset as President? 
1:::Money   Ideology   Coercion    Ego
1:::I've got a red/blue control/burn deck explicitly built without a card costing more than 3 mana to avoid ever being tapped out/manafucked.  it's probably my favorite deck but my friends hate when I play it. :/ most expensive card in the deck is guttersnipe.
1:::It’s such a big headline too. And yet it’s posed as a fact. This is why people call out “fake news”. It’s these whopping headlines meant to turn heads that don’t actually have a lot of substance. This article is just more of the same.   Very weird times we live in. I’m not sure what to blame tbh. 
1:::There is a distinction between "political news" and "political analysis". Trump being convicted of collusion with Russia is news; an opinion blogger publishing their interpretation of the ongoing investigation is not.
1:::His name rhymes too. I noticed it when I was scrolling back up and asking myself if it was Kream.

1:::It's so crazy how little people understand government and that just because someone was sworn in it doesn't mean everything that happened leading up to that event and the 12 months of their first term was their doing >:(
1:::I would just like to point out that although what you’re saying is true, the idea that the debt and deficit are problems that need to be solved in some way is largely incorrect.  As long as our debt to GDP ratio is good (and it’s been getting dangerously close to *not* good thanks to outrageous Republican military spending) and inflation is kept under control, our economy is strong regardless of how much debt we carry, because what defines the value of our currency is the value of our economy.  The American dollar has value equal to what the American dollar will buy, in terms of goods, services, or currency.  As a reserve currency, arguably the *only* reserve currency in the world, we’re uniquely positioned this way.  There is a point at which investors and other nations will stop buying US bonds and such, but we haven’t seen a really weak market do this in quite a while.  So while it will be good to have responsible Democrats back in control after this nightmarish regime, they certainly don’t need to worry about balancing the budget and paying down the debt.  Those issues were largely invented by Republicans to justify cutting government programs along with the rest of their hypocritical belt-tightening-for-everyone-except-the-wealthy and trickle-down economics.  It’s in the same category as concepts like “tax and spend liberal.”  We need to purge these notions from our thinking as opposed to internalizing them.    Austerity is bullshit, the deficit is not a problem, fuck yeah entitlements forever.
1:::If there's a waiting debt for a Democratic president you can A) Blame them for said debt B) Prevent them from having funding for the programs they'd like to put in place.  Budget hawks my ass.
1:::Republicans will shout down the Dems for the debt, the dems fix the debt and then the republicans get elected and see the benefits of the dems fix, over and over
1:::Bbbut hannity told me that good thing the REPUBLICAN party came along and ended slavery because it was a bad thing. 
1:::I don’t remember where I heard the term, but some call the current climate a “cold civil war”. 
1:::What a silly way to frame our current climate.
1:::Yep.  However, what will unite us above the division is the horrific state of our ecology.  Lots of republicans are finally admitting it and will join the bandwagon of the new paradigm, especially if the dems are smart enough to be gracious in victory and include them willingly.  The die hards of trumpism will die that way no matter what.  But they're more than likely a small minority.
1:::It just goes to show that after Sherman marched to the sea, he should have turned right back around and gone all the way back to Virginia. Its shitty, but sometimes this shit needs to happen, like the US firebombing of Japan until there was literally nothing left to burn, or the USSR's merciless domination and repression of Germany.

1:::Love this, wish I would have done the same, and also realize that I am in no mood to retroactively search through the history of the posts of _those_ social media friends to make this a reality. Good on you. Would love to se an update once the dust from all of this settles. 
1:::Amen.
1:::I have screenshots saved on my HDD, in my Dropbox, and in DVD format to send to all THEIR friends and family members (complete with the dulcet sounds of my commentary) if they ever decide to act like they weren't complete shitstains. I have a lot of time on my hands, and yes it is an absolute blast being this petty.
1:::The problem is that this leaves them nowhere to go. Lao Tzu would tell you that it is a bad idea to leave an enemy no out if you only want to defeat them (rather than destroy them utterly).  I think we need to do what you do, but tie it to something like “your vote for Trump, however tortured and reluctant it may have been, means you are my enemy. I will make peace when you have been defeated utterly. This means, no visiting your grandkids, no being in my business, no being invited to my party, and expect constant scorn until you successfully rid the federal bench of Trump appointees.  You may regain my respect, posthumously, if you die in service of this cause (such as self-immolation).”
1:::Please share these after
1:::Riposters
1:::They'll blame Obama saying that if he wasn't so mean to Trump at the Corespondent's Dinner, Trump would have never ran for office out of spite. 
1:::I spent two minutes on TD today.    First post, "the investigation is a witch Hunt and Mueller has NOTHING."   First comment, "literally everyone is a liar besides Donald"   I commented "he's got cohen" and I was banned instantly"
1:::People unironically blame Obama for 9/11 so I wouldn't doubt it. 
1:::German here, can confirm. That’s what happened and what will happen in the US. 
1:::Yep. And suddenly the wehrmacht had nothing to do with any atrocities. And every country that was liberated was 80% resistance fighters all along!
1:::And suddenly Chinese-style "re-education" camps start making some sense.
1:::We need to talk about it with them. Once (If) they are willing to listen to the truth, we must have a long and difficult talk as a country. How did we get here, how do we prevent it from happening again, etc.  What we must NOT do are the same things we did for Civil Rights. There is a deep wound. A band-aid won't help.
1:::That sounds nice and all but, ya know, the Equal Rights Amendment **still** hasn't been ratified. You're looking at a major multi-generational effort.
1:::Honestly, as sad as it is, this is the reaction I'm expecting. 
1:::Until a red supreme court rules Trump can pardon anything, and there's a case coming up that may allow a ruling on it.
1:::I can’t even describe how hard I laughed at “take home test”. I’m literally in tears 
1:::Mississippi runoff election just ended
1:::Donny finally turned in his homework so we get to see what some of the correct answers are as Mueller grades his paper.
1:::Dont forget Trump gave his written sworn statements last week.  I think that was the biggest piece of the puzzle.  As soon as he gave his answers they turned on Manafort because he lied. 
1:::The midterms were a month ago, but not all the races were decided a month ago.
1:::MS runnoff election just ended.
1:::Oh cool, my worst fears have a Reddit account.
1:::Trump is too proud. They’d announce he got sick and the next day at 4:45am he’d tweet “WEAK Mike Pence and little paul making up fake news, I’m still winning and president. SAD”
1:::From what I understand, any vp nomination has to be confirmed by both houses, so you're taking all of this happening before January?
1:::He will never admit to being ill. Not the way he makes fun of low energy people.
1:::Thankfully Trump’s narcissism will most definitely prevent him from stepping down. He’ll drown first.

1:::I think they also timed it for when he'd be out of the country. Limit his ability to influence or interfere with what is going down. 
1:::When one practices the law, one should never ask a question to a defendant without knowing the answer before hand.
1:::The NYT doesn't throw down these types of claims willy-nilly.  Even if it has been common knowledge for the last two years, they wouldn't dare report it so brazenly with this headline unless they were rock-solid.  Having them just pull out their balls and slap them on the table like this takes serious confidence, otherwise they can and will be sued to death for defamation/libel.  Basically it's taken two years for the public to get verification of what was common-knowledge in the intelligence community back during the campaign.  Hillary even called him out on this back in 2016, prompting the infamous "NO PUPPET, NO PUPPET!  YOU'RE THE PUPPET!" response.
1:::I have a bad feeling they're going to get away with everything
1:::> dozens of hustles and crimes all orbiting around the 2016 Trump campaign. It's a Star Wars Cantina of dirtbags pulled together by the election  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.

1:::See everyone looks at this like a tv series but it’s more like the MCU movie franchise with origin stories and seperate storylines converging and weaving about. 
1:::I just call it a Ratfuck King.
1:::I truly believe the Russian influence of the 2016 election will go down in history as one of the most successful internarional espionage operations ever.

1:::Trump also talked about his love affair with Kim...
1:::tiny little circles.
1:::Do you really think something as benign as a pee tape is what brought the "Billionaire President" Donald to his knees and his tongue to Putin's boots? 
1:::The trick is that by these accounts, the deal fell through.  I could believe that Donald just didn't think he needed to pay off Putin the way that everyone else in Russia does.
1:::Well he had a choice. But he was never going to. Because of the implication.
1:::I'll always love Stephen Colbert's day with a Russian Oligarch:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5YJ7mh8zWc

1:::Wow how is this the first time I've ever seen this.
1:::I recently spent eight years not having to imagine that, it was pretty nice.  
1:::That was like 20 years ago right?
1:::I don't care what your kink is. But this is not a kink. This is racism. And hatred.  I'm not saying the peepee tape is real. But any person that would fly to another country and hire prostitutes who do not live in a country with legal and societal protection just to urinate over the bed two people stayed in, one of whom you pushed a racist conspiracy over, yeah - that's not a kink. And this would not be a man that should be in charge of the nuclear weapons and the fate of Americans and much of the world.  Also yeah: eewww lol
1:::70-year-old Trump bunions and corns soaking in hepatitis hooker urine. Nah, that's gross. 
1:::Underage?
1:::It’s not Pee Tape - it’s the ‘P’ Tape. You tell me what that stands for (hit does the name Jeff Epstein mean anything to you?)
1:::Which is why he would feel so comfortable just letting loose.
1:::Republicanism has replaced Christianity in terms of doctrine, and republicanism is not based on anything moral or ethical. Their Christian nation was killed off by them and they're too brainwashed to know it.
1:::Hell its even more than that...  We are still feeling the effects of the Reagan Administration saying fuck the debt, trickle down economics, and terribly short sighted energy policies..... 
1:::“Lowest black unemployment!”   /r
1:::However, the interest payment we are *wasting* could pay for medicare for all, free college tuition and infrastructure.
1:::How do I gild on my phone?
1:::Our debt to GDP is a bit higher than I'd prefer. But it's certainly not at a dangerous level. It'll get there in the next 10 years with this ridiculous republican agenda. Then when the next recession hits, the government will not be able to spend through it, making the recession harsher and longer. At which point, republicans will say, "Look what the democrats did."  But hey, some people saved a couple hundred on their taxes. Woo. /s  I hate how transparently evil the GOP is, given even the slightest economic knowledge.
1:::>they certainly don’t need to worry about balancing the budget and paying down the debt. Those issues were largely invented by Republicans to justify cutting government programs along with the rest of their hypocritical belt-tightening-for-everyone-except-the-wealthy and trickle-down economics  The right cravenly exploits these issues to further it's anti-government agenda.  The reason that a national debt is not necessarily a bad thing is because national governments tend to i) have control of the currency the debt is issued in, and ii) can use debt-financed spending to increase the future tax base. Issuing ten billion dollars in debt at 2% is a fantastic deal for a government that spends that ten billion dollars on infrastructure or education or what have you that will grow the economy, resulting in more than ten billion dollars in increased tax revenue down the road. And that's not even considering the fact in many circumstances governments can create money to pay off debt without causing inflation. This is first-year economics.   But if you're anti-government as a matter of ideology, you don't want the government to have to the power to enact those kinds of long-term spending programs, and, frankly, you *don't want to the government to succeed at anything*. So you promulgate the idea that "the government is like a household, you can't spend more than you bring in" not because you believe in it (it's very hard to believe in if you are even vaguely familiar with the area) but because it's an effective way of getting the public to vote against long-term, positive-expected-value investment in the nation.  I'm agreeing with what you're already said, I realise. But I guess my point is that it's not just about belt-tightening - it's a movement against the very idea of the government as the leader of a nation, of a nation to collectively invest in itself for the benefit of society at large. 
1:::And the people who made up the Republican party of then are not the people who make up the Republican party of now.
1:::But heaven forbid Democrats take down statues of Confederate Democrats
1:::> Its shitty, but sometimes this shit needs to happen, like the US firebombing of Japan until there was literally nothing left to burn, or the USSR's merciless domination and repression of Germany.   The West de-Nazified Germany with a lot less brutality and repression.
1:::Well if you study the unified Germany and the "west" vs "east" side. There is very little doubt that the west side came out WAY ahead. SO the USSR's "merciless domination and repression of Germany" was not a good thing.
1:::Can't believe Jefferson Davis only did two years in jail...

1:::Punching supporters of treason in the face is a morally appropriate, and patriotic, thing to do, bad hombre..... 
1:::Far right terrorism the fastest growing threat? But what about that ONE GUY with a bike lock?! /s
1:::I don't of think exposing the bigots and fascists among us as petty.   Seems more like our patriotic duty.
1:::"**YOU** did this, I just voted for him"
1:::I got banned before the election.  Wasn't even trolling.  Just asking questions instead of commenting 'millipede' or whatever, I guess.
1:::We have to start with those responsible - Fox News and RW talk radio. They have lied to and radicalized these people - and they were wrong about all of this
1:::> we must have a long and difficult talk as a country  This is pretty much what Hillary campaigned on. There are a lot of things that America desperately needs to grow up on. Coal jobs are gone. Rural areas are fucked because of the modern economy. Racism and misogyny are alive and strong as ever. Pretending like these are not issues or that you have a magic solution is so wishful and stupid that only a child would fall for it.      Hillary assumed that America was ready to grow up and have some big talks. She was wrong. 
1:::It's going to be a mess. We have to amend the constitution but can't be tricked into doing having  constitutional  convention while the Republicans have leverage to Koch it up. We can try legislation, but the SC will smack it down.
1:::At that point people would probably be in full on insurrection mode. 
1:::Jesus Christ, I forgot about this. 
1:::Roberts said as loudly as a Chief Justice can that they're not going to let democracy-breaking happen.
1:::That's true. It was a bit of a foregone conclusion though.
1:::Nope, it actually had more to do with the written questions Trump turned in. That timeline makes a lot more sense.
1:::Lol, and it’s name is namaste mothafucka
1:::Read the article but don't see it.  It looks more and more that if Trump goes down it's gonna be a "conflict of interest" type of thing that Pence doesn't share.  Since the Flynn thing I've been sure that keeping Pence squeaky clean has been important to the Republicans, and for good reason.  
1:::The fact that they indicted all those Russian hackers right before he met with Putin last time makes me think that might actually be legit
1:::With the bonus possibility Trump will respond by not coming back.
1:::It’s in the Opinion section...
1:::This article is an op ed though.
1:::Right. Don't get me wrong; this is by far the most consequential day of the Russia investigation so far.  But it's all stuff that was known and reported for a long time now 
1:::On a federal level, it’s entirely possible they will, either as a “let’s mend our divide pardon” bullshit but the state level crimes make me think something will actually happen...  Given the seriousness of this particular conspiracy it doesn’t seem right to just say, we learned and won’t let it happen again...this is basically a puppet government installed over our own. 
1:::Yes, a huge group of people in high positions facing life in jail or worse have little reason not to pursue a coup.  Right-wing media has been talking up such a thing for a long time.
1:::Makes that Venture Bros Episode with a party being thrown by the super villains, having Trump in the background all the funnier.
1:::These are definitely the droids we're looking for.
1:::Burn After Reading
1:::"Cohen? Oh, he's the best."  *Announcer: Cohen was far from the best.*
1:::Last year I got bored and [made a deck of cards](https://i.imgur.com/3WbgH7Q.jpg) of all of these people like the Iraqi most wanted deck. It was fun but I had to keep changing all of the titles because everyone was getting fired.
1:::I hope not. If we turn the 2016 election into the story of some ingenious attack on our democracy by worthy foe Russia AND NOT a shameful moment of collective idiocy where we voted to destroy our own nation then it'll be too easy for all of us to avoid responsibility. And then the CHUDs will be emboldened to pull this shit again (like they always do).  Russia didn't outwit us; we fucked up. And every time our country has fucked up we went back and wrote ourselves an excuse in the history books. This has to be a lesson we don't forget.
1:::And he let the totally-not-secret-agent Russian news crews roam freely around the oval office.
1:::That's the one that will lead this chapter in the online history books.
1:::To be fair, that was like 12 years ago
1:::This has been the longest 2 fucking years. It's definitely taken years off my life. JFC. 
1:::This thread perfectly encapsulates everything I love about Reddit.

1:::JFC I would not want to be in the amount of debt Trump is likely in to the Putin.
1:::Da.
1:::I remember seeing this a few months ago and thinking the same thing. The most surprising part of this to me is that the intelligence community, officer corp, and judicial officials are not screaming their heads off on social media or through public message boards. The Trump admin is beneficial to oligarchs within the US and Russia; both have demonstrated their ability to use manipulation campaigns and launder money through slush funds for concealment of support
1:::Except when the guy got screwed over on the regular.
1:::Nah, only a few days ago, at the beginning of this crazy Infrastructure Week
1:::It was at least 30 mooches ago
1:::This, exactly.  If Trump likes piss? Okay. Not my thing, but you do you.  If Trump hired someone to piss on a bed because Obama once slept in it? That's a scary level of psychopathy and you're right--this guy shouldn't be in charge of a Nerf gun, let alone the US military.
1:::Its next level insecurity. He still hasn't gotten over a black man being president. It consumed him.
1:::I always thought Trump was just focusing the right's hatred of Obama for personal gain, such as his 2012 run where he went on for months about the damn birth certificate. But now it looks like Trump personally hated the guy.      I wonder why. Because Trump couldn't pay him off? Maybe Trump was intimidated by his integrity, professionalism, style and not-so-subtle aloof confidence. There's no way Trump could pull that off. He comes into a situation as a half-cocked alpha dog who only gets any respect because people assume he's some kind of big-shot Manhattan businessfuck.
1:::Oh God I really hope not. I must be naive because I didn't even think of that. Yikes.
1:::Is it bad I don’t even think that would end him?  Republicans: “they would’ve been legal in biblical times!”
1:::Immediately tearing the solar panels off the White House when he moved in sort of historically looks wretched for ol' Reagan nowadays, doesn't it? 
1:::Don't forget about Nixon and allowing healthcare to be for profit.
1:::Ronald Reagan is how and why we ended up with Trump
1:::Bush fixed Reagans incompetence.  But he gets shit on.  Clinton reaps the benefits doesn't do anything to fuck it up then Bush Jr Tells Reagan to hold his beer.  Obama comes in cleans the clusterfuck up in his first 2 years when he could then republican spent 6 years trying to fuck him over.  Then we have the orange Tangerine who doesn't understand that a larger money supply means inflation which means you have to raise interest rates to try and slow spending which then slows the economy which will likely happen late next year.  But oh well vote republican tea party idiots and watch the world collapse again. 
1:::"/r"   it's like /s but with 100% more traitors.
1:::Yeah, but there is no magic fix. A Democrat running on a platform of reducing the debt is gonna fail and it's not some impossible problem to solve. The way to do it isn't sexy, it's just old fashioned accounting and enough votes in Congress. 
1:::yup, but fuck gold. (cause fuck reddit) order 'em a sandwich or something

1:::True, but Mueller follows the rules
1:::We thought Hillary was a foregone conclusion and then resistance hero James Comey held a press conference about her emails. 
1:::I think it's probably both.
1:::It be great they packed up air force one and went home while he was still asleep in his hotel. 
1:::Now imagine if Trump bails on the country and absconds to Russia instead of coming home!
1:::I don't see how this just blows over one way or the other.   I think that a very clear and strong message needs to be sent with how this is all handled...no idea what that means in terms of details...but *IF* it is all as it has appeared, I feel as though the most serious consequences need to be levied.   There are 63 million people that voted for this, that will still be around ... that is unfixable.

1:::And he also walked into the dressing room of the miss America contestants, who were all underage.
1:::I've said it before, but I think the only way that his base would consider turning on him is if Putin released a tape of him molesting an under-aged *boy*.
1:::This is my favorite little-known fact about Reagan. To me, it really helped crystalize my understanding of him as an asshat.  
1:::Well, one good thing Nixon did do was the EPA.
1:::Nixon and health care was very complex.  He proposed a solution similar to Obamacare back in the 70s but significantly more robust.  It was a little like how Germany handles healthcare.  Ted Kennedy shot it down hoping for a single payer solution.  In the end nothing was ever signed and the system stayed.  
1:::Yeah people forget trump is the second actor president 
1:::It's like /n with 100% more Windows
1:::Just listen to Bernie Sander's platform because that is the platform I will vote for.
1:::I got myself a sandwich instead. Writing good comments better be its own reward for this redditor I guess.
1:::thoughts and prayers
1:::He's still very conservative. But he's not going to rule that the President can usurp all institutions, including his own. Roberts is a very smart person who has read his history. If Roberts ruled Trump can pardon anyone he wants, it's about half a step from firing the entire court and declaring himself king. Roberts has no loyalty to Trump. He will be on the bench decades after triump is gone.
1:::What a concept.
1:::If only we had Comey to report on Ivanka's emails. 
1:::Yeah, my blood boils when I see someone retweet something from Comey that is negative about Donald or something he thinks is inspirational or sage advice on the justice system. I'm like, hey asshole, YOU CAUSED THIS.
1:::Invest in education.  I know it's the long-game, but that's how we fix this.
1:::Duetsche Bank was raided today.
1:::I'd almost forgotten about Kennedy, that fucking snake. He's why we have Kavanaugh.
1:::It speaks to a level of pettiness and derangement that is unbefitting for a world leader.
1:::And Title IX. 
1:::And in between the ex Chief of the CIA and his idiot son. Beyond W's inability to speak in complete sentences there are some moral conflicts inside him I just can't live with.  He stood up for Muslims after 9/11, but he condoned torture, invaded the wrong country while declaring a never ending war (and so far it is still ongoing) and enacted spying on US citizens as official policy.
1:::Bernie is absolutely correct, his platform is awesome but this is not his core message. The national debt isn't even listed on his website's issues page:  https://berniesanders.com/issues/  What's great about Bernie is as a side effect of his already amazing policies the debt would go down anyway:  https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-bernie-pays-for-his-proposals/  If you don't believe it can happen read the studies at the bottom of the page. All reputable, no bullshit.
1:::You can't eat that sandwich right now unless you brought enough for the rest of thread.
1:::Everything you've said rings true. I was merely pointing out that Citizens United was a democracy-breaking ruling and Roberts oversaw that.
1:::Or the paperboy.
1:::Rolled back environmental protections, hired energy lobbyists to farm out sweetheart deals to energy companies, allowed his vp to enrich himself through government contracts...
1:::Yeah but at least he was a champion of small government /s
1:::That was my point.  He is not running on fixing the deficit. He is running on sound doable ideas that a rather  good number of financially sound countries already have in place.  We should follow their example.
1:::Thank you.  I just don't have the energy to list all of his crimes. :)
