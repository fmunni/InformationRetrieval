1:::This is a family separation i can get behind
1:::Mueller has documents...   https://mobile.twitter.com/rebeccaballhaus/status/1068267354302361606
1:::The Trump family name will go down as traitors, all because the egomaniac couldn't handle being mocked by a black guy who was more liked.
1:::Oh boy. This doesn’t even include trump soho which the trump kids were almost prosecuted for fraud about. Until they donated money to Cyrus Vance.   They are screwed, but they did it to themselves. Mueller is just showing us who they are. 
1:::Ivanka Trump is friends with Wendi Deng. Wendi Deng is Putin's girlfriend. Anyone remember seeing pictures of the two during the campaign? I do! Hmmmm, I wonder what they talked about?
1:::Tiffany seen chuckling softly 
1:::This is great. Only because they should of got out of dodge after pulling their scheme. I am hoping and praying somebody runs. We need that entertainment.
1:::Those two defrauded investors in the Trump SoHo condo building and only got away with it when the local DA was ~~paid off~~ given a donation and refused to file any charges.
1:::And there it is.  Ivanka's going to jail. 
1:::I am most interested in Ivanka Trump’s arrest. Hear me out.   She pisses me off more than the rest of them. We are the same age. We grew up in the same area around similar people. I got there through merit, she got there because her racist granddaddy had money. She is an embarrassment, a liar, an opportunist and one of the worst women I have ever had the misfortune of knowing about.   She pisses me off like no other because the world we grew up in was progressive and conducive to women succeeding on merit. But she still CHOSE to cling to her family’s ill gotten riches and develop her whisper Disney Princess voice and web of intricate lies rather than participate in the world around her. I fucking hate her. I cannot wait for her to go to prison. She is beyond redemption. 
1:::Mueller is going after Trump’s children now?? Trump gonna be FURIOUS
1:::Today was a good day    [https://imgur.com/a/TLK78fl](https://imgur.com/a/TLK78fl)
1:::A couple of weeks ago Don Jr. said he expects to get indicted any day. That makes even more sense now.
1:::If this is what Thursday was like, I can't wait for Friday!
1:::Hopefully they were stupid enough to use the private email servers for contact on this, and they were intercepted and passed on to evidence. That would be extra juicy buttery males justice.
1:::>Ivanka  And here comes the REAL flailing from Trump. I have zero doubt that Donnie would throw Junior under the bus as soon as it was convenient, but Ivanka is his prized possession. She is his actual red line.
1:::Where's Eric in all this? Was he too stupid to be involved?
1:::Ivanka smiles broadly at regular intervals during interviews, though...that will save her and that always confused/panicked husband.
1:::Shit Apple doesn't fall far from the shit tree.
1:::‘He had better keep his eyes off my girlfriend and my asshole son.’ Trump. 
1:::I hope Mueller drops indictments on those two while Trump is meeting with Xi. 
1:::Hope Hicks on suicide watch 
1:::Trump’s worst move for himself was deciding to run for president. 
1:::Cage his children...  Only seems fair.
1:::Today is my Christmas
1:::That's the first time I have seen Ivanka's name in connection to any if this. 
1:::All the boys think he’s a spy, he’s got Robert Mueller eyes…
1:::This is the part of the Watergate speedrun that gets super technical 
1:::I really want to know what Rick Santorum, Hugh Hewitt, and Cory Lewindowski think of today’s developments   /s
1:::*We are family*  *Brother sister felony*
1:::Anyone related to the Trump family or business should have their sphincters fully clenched at this point.
1:::Trump running for president in spite of Obama may take out his whole family 
1:::Lock them up!
1:::“Mueller looking into ___ doing ____” = Mueller has found ____ is guilty of ____
1:::Families that crime together, stay ~~in federal prison~~ together.
1:::Womp womp.
1:::The trump's are the o'doyles from Billy Madison.
1:::The whole shitty Trump family is going to prison, and what few real assets they have will be forfeit.
1:::On the day they get perp walked, I hope Obama gets photographed kite surfing again.
1:::He probably already has...last year. 
1:::About to go 1776 on America’s prince and princess. Death to nepotism. 
1:::Any trump getting indicted before Christmas would be the greatest gift of all.
1:::Junior testified to Congress that he knew nothing about Trump Tower Moscow... he’s going down. 
1:::He's gunning for the family. 
1:::[mfw](https://i.imgur.com/6gRCnAr.gif)

1:::Donald Trump: ['Take out their families'](https://www.cnn.com/2015/12/02/politics/donald-trump-terrorists-families/index.html)
1:::Complicit.
1:::Nepotism.  Ha, family of crime.  They talk about dynasty with Clinton. Well then Trump don't need no dynasty, he just need to run once and install his fam in there.
1:::Just like Enron, go after co-conspirators and family first.
1:::Send that wench to jail please!
1:::But poor oompa loompa will never get a shot at having sex with his own daughter once they're all separated into different prisons!
1:::Oh yes, please. Break this corrupt family down one by one.
1:::A family that will forever be remembered in history textbooks as family of traitors. 
1:::Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into President Trump’s efforts to build a skyscraper in Moscow has led him to ask questions about the role two of the president’s children played in attempting to secure a Russian real estate deal, sources tell Yahoo News.

1:::Hide yo kids hide ya wife 
1:::add this to the equation  >Sater also provides an example of a business connection attempting to transition into the political realm. Along with the email to Cohen, which seems to suggest that Sater sees developing Trump Tower Moscow as part of a broader strategy to ensure Trump’s election, Sater was involved in an attempt during the transition to influence the administration’s policy on Russia. In January 2017, Sater and Cohen reportedly worked with the Ukrainian politician Andriy Artemenko to deliver a policy proposal rolling back sanctions against Russia to the incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Under the plan, Russia would withdraw its troops from Eastern Ukraine, while Ukraine would hold a referendum on whether to “lease” Crimea to Russia; in return, the U.S. would lift the sanctions it placed on Russia after the 2014 invasion of Crimea. Sater has repeatedly declined to comment on the matter, and there is no indication that the administration considered or acted upon the proposal.  >In March 2018, Buzzfeed published their interviews with Sater. In them, he revealed that he had worked as an intelligence asset for the CIA, DIA and FBI, most notably working to track down Osama bin Laden before 9/11, handling a source in Russia’s foreign military intelligence with information on North Korean operatives, and posing as a money launderer in Cyprus and Turkey to catch Russian and Ukrainian cybercriminals.  https://themoscowproject.org/collusion/trump-bayrock-find-site-trump-tower-moscow/  
1:::More than anything else- even seeing them in prison- I want to see that family poor.
1:::Okay news... you can stop now, there's going to be over doses tonight.
1:::This is where it gets good folks.
1:::We live in a strange timeline 
1:::Trump will just try to throw them under the bus. 
1:::imagine if his whole family goes behind bars, that would be a sight to see
1:::With today's revelations, Trump emerges as a central figure in the Mueller probe: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/individual-1-trump-emerges-as-a-central-subject-of-mueller-probe/2018/11/29/e3968994-f3f7-11e8-80d0-f7e1948d55f4_story.html?utm_term=.82b8143321a8

1:::Here it comes. Here it comes. Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown.
1:::Oh I would do near anything to watch Ivanka be complicit.
1:::Called it earlier.  My betting money is that Ivanka goes first because frankly she is the one he will do anything to protect if any of them.  Don Jr is a loser according to Trump

1:::Seth Myers and Barack trolled him into destroying his entire families legacy. 
1:::- *Arnold* - *Booth* - *Oswald* - *Nixon* - *Trump*  Names that will always be infamous in American history
1:::*"The Black Guy Made Fun of Me" - The Donald Trump Story*  Coming to a theater near you.....
1:::I think a lot of it goes back to his friendship with politicians like the clintons, he saw how easily Bill handled being president and then trump saw how much money there was in being president.  After Obama’s 2nd term he saw a opportunity to play on the fears of racist republicans and transformed a RNC that spent 8 years not governing but just obstructing. The RNC was blind sided by trumps popularity and had no good candidates to defeat him. So here we are.....
1:::Most registered republicans would get on their knees and deepthroat Trump to completion but I promise you in a decade they will say nobody liked him and that he was a democrat.
1:::> The Trump family name will go down as traitors, all because ~~the egomaniac couldn't handle being mocked by a black guy who was more liked~~ way too many Americans are also "fucking morons".   FTFY. Trump is in power because people brought his bullshit and are too partisan to ignore the truth. Those same people are going to continue to do so and are going to be really pissed when the long dick of the law comes swinging into the room to clean up this mess.
1:::Those steaks tho
1:::>all because the egomaniac couldn't handle being mocked by a black guy who was more liked  this narrative needs to die. all the evidence unearthed over the last two years demonstrates that he didn't run for president because obama made fun of him. he has been running for years, long before that dinner and before obama was even POTUS.   donald trump ran for president because he was so deeply in debt to russian oligarchs, under the leadership of putin, who had been grooming him to be used as a chaos agent, and they called in their favor. he could not resist because he was in too deep. he's not in any way absolved of guilt just because he was taking orders, but he in no way was behind the reins on any of this.
1:::And because apparently donnie moscow wanted his own hotel to f*** whores in
1:::Traitors to their country who are motivated by their hatred of black people? They sound like Confederate heros to me.  /s 🙄
1:::I wonder if his supporters will ever back down from this one.   I feel like this chapter of the American Experience is going to leave a lasting divisive mark on our country. I just don't see them backing down from their support. 
1:::Benedict Arnold is outdated all traitors going forward will be known as Trumps..
1:::Can't wait to see his name come off of every building.
1:::And he wouldn't have mocked him if Trump hadn't started the birther bullshit to begin with. 
1:::They got away with it for so long. Nobody warned them that if he ran for office and won that there would be scrutiny on everything they've done? GOOD!   The smug entitlement of the kids angers me more than the assclown of a dad they have.  Bake em away toys!
1:::Cy Vance is completely non-partisan, he’ll take money from anyone to look the other way. 
1:::Isn't she Rupert Murdoch's ex-girfriend?
1:::Ivanka oversaw a $300M trust fund on behalf of Wendi Deng's daughters
1:::Ivanka spun around in Putin’s swivel chair in his office when hanging out with Wendi if I recall correctly. No kidding.  Edit: Haha, Sater said that happened in [2006](https://www.newsweek.com/ivanka-putin-chair-spun-kremlin-931754)
1:::"wow so your dad is, like, interested in what? Sanctions?  Yeah I can, like, talk to my dad about it sure."
1:::Wendi Deng is far from being Putin's girlfriend. They were spotted together in  an oligarch's yacht and that's pretty much what set off the rumors.   I think the rumor that Putin is homosexual is much more likely. Or at least asexual. He has only had 1 known relationship, his ex-wife of 20+ years. Pretty out of the norm for a guy with power. 
1:::Wendi also introduced Ivanka and Jared. 
1:::> Wendi Deng is Putin's girlfriend.  Source? [Her Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendi_Deng_Murdoch) mentions Putin (and Russia) a total of 0 times. *Tony Blair*, on the other hand... many times.
1:::I remember seeing this and couldn't believe that story didn't take off.
1:::And suspected Chinese asset!
1:::I don’t really know a whole lot about the Tiffany story, but she must be a bit higher IQ than the others.
1:::I’d ask for an advance on my inheritance 
1:::Who?
1:::Tiffany Mapples
1:::In a white Bronco
1:::The greatest thing about the whole situation is they WANTED to lose the election. They had no intention or expectation of actually winning. They would have not only gotten away with everything, started a news media empire, gotten Moscow Tower, would've fired the Republicans into a frenzy for another decade and he would have profited the shit out of all that, all without being investigation because of the optics of going after your political rivals. Trump's greatest failure in life was was actually winning the one thing he had to fucking lose.
1:::The only things that “get out of Dodge” anymore are polling locations, after Republican officials screw the Latinx residents of Dodge out of their right to vote.

1:::Crooked Ivanka. Lock Her Up! 
1:::And where Ivanka goes, Donald goes!
1:::So does she get hauled off on the first day of Hanukkah or the last
1:::Orange is the New Orange.  Wait.
1:::Lock her up! Lock Her Up! Lock Her Up!  This is fun
1:::What the hell is up with her voice? Seriously. Is she a smoker? Heavy drinker? Heavy screamer? Is she constantly sick? Complications of a surgery? Complications from multiple issues with her vocal chords and tonsils? During puberty, did she get a heavier dose of one hormone when her vocal chords were developing more fully? What happened to her voice?  I'm not saying I don't like it at all. It's unique... I'm just completely lost on how her voice would turn out that way. A young woman with the whispery voice of a very effeminate version of Tom Waits. I know how Tom Waits got his voice... how did she?
1:::Well stated.  Not to mention she's a  traitor to her country.  Looking forward to her world falling apart.
1:::I know a lot of folks wanna see this family in jail and I’d settle for that but what I would love to see is them stripped of all their money and forced to live like a poor person in America. That would be a wonder to see. Imagine These assholes having to try and get a job. Of course, I’m not sure either is likely to happen. We aren’t great at putting whit collar criminals in jail and really making them pay for their crimes.
1:::Any interesting stories about her growing up?
1:::I agree, I went to school with her and always thought highly of her. It’s really dumbfounding that she has gone along with this so aggressively.

1:::Going to be watching the G20 stuff with interest. He has terrible control over his body language. Hell, he has terrible control over his spoken language. 
1:::As legitimate as the investigation is and the reason we all know that Mueller should be going after Ivanka and Trump Jr, I worry that this will fuel the flames Trump is trying to ignite within his ignorant base. I fear that Trump claiming that the investigation is going after his children will only give credibility, in the distorted world of Trump supporters, that he is a victim.
1:::While I’m looking forward to a Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump indictment, I really hope it doesn’t happen tomorrow. I’m going out of town and won’t have WiFi until I reach my motel-if that. I will be super pissed if I missed the president’s kids getting put in handcuffs  
1:::Didn't you just say in another post that Trump has Mueller right where he wants him? If that is true, why is he furious about Mueller going after his children? Clearly by your own admission he is contained is he not?
1:::Does he really care that much about any of his kids? I feel like he really doesn’t. I think he might stick his neck out a little for Ivanka, but wouldn’t put himself on the line for her.
1:::I'm nervous. I feel like we've entered Willy Wonka's Mueller Prosecution Factory and I'm gorging on the news and I think I'm like that girl who blows up from it.  The oompa loompas better be coming for the big oompa loompa soon.
1:::Better rest up for tomorrow!
1:::I’m going out of town tomorrow and won’t be without WiFi until my motel. If this is Thursday, I’m going to be pissed if I miss Don Jr, Jared and Ivanka be put in handcuffs. I won’t be able to enjoy it. 
1:::The fact she went out of her way to address this  in an interview says a lot. I’m sure that private email use will be damning 
1:::Trump already threw JR under the bus in the summer and said that he was the one who organized the Trump tower meeting. Everyone basically forgot about this. 
1:::Yup. Mueller takes Ivanka out last. Trump is an animal trapped in a corner. He'd do crazy dangerous stuff if Ivanka was targeted. 
1:::He was probably having a pudding pop. 
1:::He's waiting for somepenis.
1:::Who?
1:::I’ve been wondering that too, for the last several months.  Was Eric not trusted to be in Donald’s closest inner circle?  He doesn’t seem to be involved in the same way,  and doesn’t seem to have nearly the same motivation to follow in his father’s footsteps as Don Jr. and Ivanka have. 
1:::A seal ate his hand

1:::There was a story about some fishiness concerning a trump property in Vancouver. I can't even remember any details, too much else has gone on since then.
1:::What does the frothy discharge byproduct of anal sex have to do with Trump or Russia? 
1:::*We do felonies, my brother and my sister and me!*  *And I'm Eric!*
1:::He's not gunning for anyone, he's following the evidence.  
1:::Good - they belong in prison.
1:::this is the end  I feel like We’ve been saying that it’s the end ever since the first indictment, but, if Mueller is really going after the kids + Kushner, it’s end game territory.  This is the last move before Trump himself. 
1:::Um no, The family left a trail of crimes and Mueller is following the evidence to them.
1:::The crimes they committed (and left evidence for, which Mueller has uncovered) are gunning for them.  Mueller is just a public servant doing his job - and doing it well. 
1:::But what a way to go
1:::And feed them nachos with extra pepper spray on top. 
1:::And film it all Arrested Development style!!  We can have Ron Howard narrate it and everything.   
1:::Well seeing what happened with Manafort, the Mueller probe will turn a huge profit after he seizes Trump the Traitor's family assets and returns them to the taxpayers
1:::Maybe it's time I got into the private prison business. I've got a small dog kennel and a stun gun. I'll pay $100 a day and that my final bid.
1:::Daddy pokes booboo while greaseball jr. looks on.
1:::Liquidate their assets and give the people some money back. 
1:::> I say shove them in one cell.  Make Jr watch while Ivanka shows why she's Daddy's favorite.
1:::They’ll punish each other more than we ever could.  Stream that shit on the internet.
1:::Best Hell in a Cell ever. 
1:::As long as it would be just Ivanka, I'm sure Donald would be for that too.
1:::Is there such a thing as Trump without gas?

1:::Who *hasn't* been caught making deals with the president of a hostile nation while running for your own country's presidency? We all fucking do it.
1:::This is an amazing comment
1:::The Trump family legacy has always been a joke to everyone but idiot reality tv fans.
1:::Unfortunately we don't know what the Trump family might try take with them in their destruction. 
1:::And our country - that's kind of a big one.
1:::Obama is clearly playing the true 69D chess.  Trump inflames and vocalizes the conspiracy theory that Obama was born in Africa.  This flips a switch deep in Obamas suppressed rage center “he’s insulting my mom” is the only thought he has, but on repeat.  Rage is cold and it never, ever dies.  Obama goads the narcissistic fool at the dinner, knowing he’ll run for president.  Then Obama convinces the DNC and Hillary to tank their campaigns and piss of Sanders supporters, ensuring Trumps win.  Then he coddles Mcconnell about Russia.  Up next is telling Comey to get himself fired, thus triggering the Mueller investigation.  Everything Trump has slowly turns to ash, his empire, legacy, family and wealth destroyed. An asterisk appears next to his name in textbooks, he replaces Benedict Arnold as synonymous with traitor.  Obama lights one final cigarette on his balcony and says to himself “no one insults my mom”
1:::*family's. Then again, he likely has multiple bastards running around so maybe families is correct.
1:::Destroying my family, to own the libs.
1:::His legacy was already a joke.
1:::holy shit guys. If this goes down the way we all hope it should this comment is genius. 
1:::“Donald Trump is running as a Republican. That’s funny I thought he was running as a joke.” 
1:::You mean the legacy of white collar criminals and mob associates?  That shining legacy?
1:::What legacy? Owning a whorehouse in Canada and some real estate in Manhattan?
1:::At what cost? 
1:::And taking the country down with it :/
1:::At the cost of the country and humanity.

1:::Wait.. Putin’s girlfriend used to be married to the guy who owns Fox News? Wow, small world huh?
1:::Yup, she's got quite a history. When she was 21 she got her greencard from a 53yo married guy (Jake Cherry ran off with her and left his wife who was teaching her English and letting her live in her home at Jakes request). He met her while helping to open a factory in China. She was an intern under Murdoch in the 90s.  Very entrepreneurial spirit. She must have quite the presence.  https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/1372878/How-Murdochs-wife-won-her-ticket-to-America.html  > In 1987 she gained her "ticket out of China" when she met an American couple from Los Angeles, Jake and Joyce Cherry. Mrs Cherry, whose husband was building a factory in China, agreed to teach Miss Deng English. When Mrs Cherry went back to the United States her husband stayed in China and soon after, he told her that Miss Deng wanted to go to America to study there.  > The couple sponsored her application for a student visa and agreed to put her up until she had established herself. Miss Deng, then 19, went to live at the Cherry's home in 1988 and shared a bunk bed with their five-year-old daughter.  > Mrs Cherry grew increasingly suspicious about her husband's relationship with Miss Deng. The report added: "Mrs Cherry recalls discovering a cache of photographs her husband had taken of Miss Deng in coquettish poses in his hotel room in Guanzhou."  Pretty sure Tony Blair and Eric Schmidt (Google) were involved with her as well.  edit: Yup, https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2014/03/wendi-deng-note-tony-blair (this is a great read)  edit2: Her PR guy is Chris Giglio, why do I know this name

1:::Isn't Putin "dating" that young dancer?  This is the first I'm hearing of a gay Putin.
1:::He does have a daughter from that relationship, though, if memory serves. That doesn't mean he couldn't be gay or bi, though.
1:::I can’t imagine what a date with Putin would be like. Where would you go? What would you talk about? Does he have a hidden softer side??
1:::Maybe because it was only reported in tabloids in 2016 and it appears to be false. She is most definitely a Chinese spy though.      >US intelligence last year warned Jared Kushner, the senior adviser to President Donald Trump, that his close friend Wendi Deng Murdoch could be a Chinese spy^^[[1]](https://www.businessinsider.com/kushner-warned-that-his-friend-wendi-deng-murdoch-may-be-a-chinese-spy-2018-1)      1.

1:::There are just way too many conflicts on this thread. Something suspicious is up with this issue.
1:::She's in law school. At least she will have a job skill besides grifting. 
1:::She took her mom's side in the divorce.  She's had little to do with her dad for most of her adult life, sometimes going years without seeing him.  I expect she'll be the first one to change her name.
1:::Barron as well. He's staying out of all this shit. 
1:::She will be the normal Trump. Calling it!
1:::She grew up on the other side of the country as her father and step siblings. Never asked anything of Trump until Ivanka asked him for a credit card for her as she was going to law school. 
1:::Did not work, because the Dems still won big in Kansas.
1:::So is it Latin-X or Latinks? I don't think I've heard it said.
1:::That, plus this Putin $50mil bribery scheme makes three instances of corruption and bribary..  You guys.. I'm beginning to thing these Trump's aren't so squakly clean
1:::It's kind of beautiful cause the reflexive pardon from Trump should then immediately trigger impeachment talk and mass protests, cause you know, we're not a monarchy.
1:::Oh I'm sure the NY state AG will be told of any state level crimes as well.  Trump can't pardon those.
1:::Jared is only let out of his gimp suit for public appearances.   Kisses are things that happen to other people.
1:::https://i.imgur.com/6BhKTMb.gif 
1:::And possibly Vlad.  She *did* go to Moscow.
1:::Jared and Ivanka only kiss on the cheek. Daddy gets tongue.
1:::Ok what's the consensus for what we think Jared and Ivanka are up to behing closed doors? On the spectrum of closed eyed mossionary to basement kink dungeon
1:::There is a sealed pardon in tRUmps desk for her.

1:::Swiggity swooty he coming for that booty 
1:::We thought there was enough evidence for only one indictment, but instead, we got eight!  Such is the Miracle of Muellerkah!
1:::Don't forget Kushner!
1:::She made it that way. It’s done on purpose and it works on some people. It’s supposed to be throaty and sexy. It repulses me but apparently many people are attracted to it. 
1:::[she has a sexy secret](https://youtu.be/q9L0wo34G8o) 
1:::When you speak with vocal fry for long enough, the vocal folds can atrophy.
1:::OP please answer this question.
1:::"Never met them, they were just coffee children"
1:::Probably not Ivanka, but Jr and Eric, definitely.  I actually saw a theory someone tossed around on here that maybe Jr. isn't his biological son, and maybe he is actually Vince McMahon's.  It's probably nothing though other than it's just funny to think about the various Game of Thrones and Arrested Development analogies we can tie the Trumps to.

1:::...yes
1:::I'd like my Trump steak well done. 
1:::Accept that his presidency will leave a dark mark on our country not likely to be forgotten any time soon by either our allies, or our foes. I will experience great joy seeing their name in ashes for what they've done to us, but it will take years if not decades to unfuck ourselves.
1:::It would be if Trump didn't troll America for 100x the damage. 
1:::I'll admit there was a 2-3 year stretch where I enjoyed that fast-food television. And then the obnoxious fuck came down an escalator and tried to destroy my country. 
1:::Now it will go down not as a joke but as a mark of shame. 
1:::Lady liberty is still standing. The lines are definitely weakened but haven't broken yet. When Trump pulls a Saddam Hussein and sits idly smoking a cigar next to a recently tortured Chuck Schumar who starts naming Democrats to be taking out in front of the capitol to either be shot or do the shooting.... that's when I know the country is lost. 
1:::I'm clapping as hard as I've ever done it before.
1:::Recall that he directed the US intelligence agencies to share more info between them just before checking out.  https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/12/obama-expands-the-nsas-ability-to-share-data-with-other-agencie/  >President Barack Obama's administration passed the changes in its final days in the White House  Now consider the ACA, *which is a Republican-sourced plan.* With it in place, the one alternative to it that would be better is single payer.   Regardless of what you think of his presidency overall, that fucker can play chess.
1:::The Kushner family won't escape unscathed.
1:::I'm dyslexic and fairly stupid but lucky more often than not. So I guess it does kinda work out. 
1:::I like to believe this entire episode was a stress test on our country that we'd either fail or overcome and get stronger. And lately I'm feeling like it'll be the latter. Trump will get thrown out of office. The entire GOP will be shamed for standing behind him so shamelessly. Laws and procedures will be passed to prevent this madness from happening again and the entire population is more engaged in the democratic process.      Though, even if we fix this mess and come out stronger, there's no way this planet escapes the climate change that's already in motion and a healthy portion of us are all dead in 30 years anyway so who gives a fuck. 
1:::[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination\_Vacation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_Vacation)  Sarah Vowell writes many fascinating and quirky history books.

1:::Only because everyone also forgets about McKinley.
1:::Wake me up, before you Czolgosz.  
1:::Amazing comment you did the work I didn’t want to
1:::Be serious man, kids don't know what Futurama is anymore.  Source: I'm a teacher. 
1:::I loved that movie Carpool. Some of his best acting. 
1:::Schwarzenegger could be on that list for Junior or Jingle All The Way. IMO those are both pretty serious crimes. Hercules in New York is pretty heinous too, but Pretzi just barely saves that flick.
1:::is joke
1:::He’s partial to money. 
1:::The rich really just end up fucking all the same people. 
1:::High-level criminal scumbags and their enablers are an incestuous bunch.
1:::Imagine knowing the woman you are fucking used to fuck Murdoch. Putin is one *sick* bastard. 
1:::The woman who is Putin’s girlfriend and Rupert Murdoch’s ex-wife has also been accused of being an asset for Chinese intelligence (MSS).
1:::Wendi Deng must have some Bond Villain grade pussy. When she opens her legs I bet it’s like opening the Raiders Ark. Yet she looks like Karen from Human Resources. 
1:::This is fake news. While she was married to Rupert Murdoch she isn't dating Putin. Check out Snopes' article about this: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ivanka-trump-with-vladimir-putin-and-wendi-murdoch/
1:::There are more attractive people that could be had by any of these guys, and far more prestigious relationships, so what's so special about her?
1:::Where does it mention she is dating/married to Putin now? None of your articles mention Putin. All I found were rumors from tabloids from 2016. She is considered to be a Chinese spy by US Intelligence, but married/dating Putin?? I see no evidence of this.
1:::> coquettish means flirtatious 
1:::> She must have quite the presence.  If by that you mean "She must be able to suck the chrome off a trailer hitch," then yes.
1:::I'm pretty sure she is a spy. Did you see her take out that pie guy? That was some ninja shit. 
1:::[So says Clive Palmer](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2412479/Clive-Palmer-claims-Murdoch-divorcing-Wendi-Deng-Chinese-spy.html)!
1:::Oh, you missed the official address he gave a few years ago announcing it?  https://youtu.be/LumrMDXBGM8
1:::Yes, and reportedly has fathered her two children.
1:::There are rumors of many relationships but none have ever been witnessed.
1:::There's at least one joke buried in there. Maybe as many as six.
1:::Barron is too busy patrolling The Cyber to get caught up in his dad's crooked dealings. 
1:::People like to speculate that he’s on the spectrum but I doubt it, he probably just never got to have a real childhood. I recently saw a video of him when he was a young child and he spoke with a pretty heavy Slovenian accent.
1:::I guarantee he turns out to be a piece of shit like his siblings, just probably not as dumb. Melania is a terrible role model and I doubt she's the greatest parent.
1:::I hope that when Trump comes back, he is arrested when he comes off of the plane, that would be so cool!
1:::You would think so. If you'd asked me half a decade ago if a president could just hire their children for no other reason than their relation, I'd have said even the thought of it would spark impeachment talk. Most of what Trump just gets away with would have gotten the same reaction from me back then. The man has no idea what he's doing, and yet he's allowed to wing it -- the most important job on Earth is being played by ear.  I think an indictment of any of his children would see them instantly pardoned. If he's not going to pardon his own kids, with whom he's done business for decades, then who is he going to pardon? Presidential pardons are Trump's ace in the hole. I don't think it's a matter of if, but a matter of when. He won't know what else to do.
1:::I can already hear the talk show hosts rationalizing "But lets be honest, wouldn't you pardon your son or daughter too?"
1:::You sure about that?  &#x200B;  I would have agreed several years ago, but have you seen how the GOP has handled the investigation so far? I mean, Louie Gohmert attacked Peter Strzok for cheating on his wife. They don't care about the truth, just power.
1:::We are an oligarchy though. Protests won't matter because Fox will soon it as attacking his family. We're in for some hard times and country soul searching. 
1:::Not unless the SC gets to Gamble vs the US first.
1:::So many discusting 🍄rump with her photos
1:::Yeah, you can act and shape your voice to be a certain way, but not for the rest of your life. Your natural voice will come through, unless you've completely damaged your vocal chords (which is what Tom Waits did and what Henry Rollins did).  And the throaty voice sound being sexy? Only works for Tom Waits and Leonard Cohen. :) I'm a straight man, and damn! Those are some sexy voices. Ivanka's? ...it's all right?
1:::Maybe she gargled Daddy too much.  Mushroom wieners can do that to a throat.
1:::"Very weak coffee children. They did a favor for me once."
1:::“The girl - beautiful, real piece of ass - never met her though unfortunately. Real shame. I could be dating her if I did.”

1:::Thank you, little oompa loompa. Roll me far, far away...
1:::Stay hydrated and pace yourself!
1:::Yet somehow I am not laughing. At all. 
1:::"I may have committed some... Light treason"
1:::I didn't mean to imply a personal vendetta. I just mean that he's finally moving in on the criminal family. Mueller already whittled away everyone else in Trump's inner circle, except Roger Stone.
1:::Eh, I'll try anything once.
1:::Probably. 
1:::The Trumps definitely seem the type to create cinco de cuatro. 
1:::I might have committed some light treason
1:::The Bluths were Somewhat sympathetic, there's no redeeming quality in the Trumps. 
1:::Debt that is tied to assets though. If the FBI seizes those assets, do the creditors still get first first priority? Or is it just tough shit for them, and subsequently the trumps?
1:::Yeah but dude's talking about the Trumps not Plankton 
1:::Oops. I knew I should have looked it up
1:::That’s what I was imagining before I made the comment, I wish I remembered what episode he said it in.
1:::And with ketchup
1:::15 ounces of ketchup pls
1:::Steaks are about the only thing Trump does that you can say was "well done" 
1:::Would you like ketchup or catsup with that?
1:::Boom roasted
1:::Absolutely. Just look at the state of the Fucking **SCOTUS**.    Multiple civilian rights will be teetering on the edge for decades. 
1:::*Except?
1:::Honestly this is gonna strengthen our constitutional infrastructure once we're done cleaning the mess. In the grand scheme of history, we'll be lucky that our potential fascist reform was led the stupidest person in this country which directly led to its implosion.
1:::Well basically he had others do that for him, Istanbul. 
1:::God willing 
1:::I'd just blame it on typing fast =P
1:::Czolgogz doesn’t really roll off the tongue. I’m pretty sure in 5 minutes I won’t remember it. 
1:::...I had no idea she was my age.
1:::You shut your mouth.  That man could be cast in Gigli in place of  Ben Assclown Afflec and it will be a god damn Arnold masterpiece!!
1:::That or Deng is really just a Chinese spy
1:::us?
1:::That has been the case since ancient times. It has always been true that if you marry close to your family, there is less chance for rebellion or upheaval. It's pretty disgusting in a lot of different ways.
1:::What do you call yourselves?   THE ARISTOCRATS!  
1:::You think she actually fucked Murdoch?  They probably had a marriage arrangement like Trump/Melania/Ivanka do.
1:::I haven't even seen a picture yet but judging by these details I feel enamored. She must have some mystique more than beauty. 
1:::Cleopatra was reported to be ugly and inbred, yet she seduced Ceaser and Marc Anthony.  Some people are just plain hot, regardless of their looks. 
1:::She's hot AF for her age.
1:::Covert training in psychological manipulation probably.
1:::It vibrates
1:::Expecting solid evidence of a romance between the wealthiest and most powerful man in the world (Putin) might be difficult to corroborate, but with her past and her propensity of ladder climbing I'm not sure that it'd surprise me;  https://splinternews.com/u-s-intelligence-officials-think-wendi-deng-murdoch-is-1822101704  https://www.thedailybeast.com/tabloid-putin-and-murdochs-ex-dating  https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/03/vladimir-putin-wendi-deng-couple  IMO; Her name appears too often to ignore. Not that I really care about who Putin is dating. I just find it interesting.
1:::kid's got a tough job.
1:::I mean the only normal thing that child probably does is Soccer.    And apparently, he's good at it to boot.   If Trump could just go to one of the kids soccer games, or hell even practices it would be the most humanizing thing he has done since getting into the White House, But no not even invite the soccer team over to the white house and kick the ball around the south lawn.   Its the lack of humanity that just makes this president the fucking worst. 
1:::Do you happen to have a link to the video? What I've read is that he speaks Slovenian with his mother when they're alone.
1:::I think he just simply has a mother who is trying her absolute best to raise him as well as possible given the circumstances 
1:::Trump just might not come back. 
1:::I was really shocked by the complete and total lack of any push back from Republicans about bringing his fucking daughter and son in law into the white house. That is fucked.
1:::Pardons don’t work like how you would hope, have to explain all the crimes and if you’re just hiding more crimes they get opened up, further civil cases become very easy to win and the Trumps are a fat civil target.  Pardons aren’t a magic wand and I’m sure it took months to explain this to trump but it’s worth repeating for the internet too, they are all fucked and fucked harder than a pardon can fix.
1:::I can already imagine footage of McConnell dodging and ducking away from reporters and cameras as the headlines crawl across the screen below

1:::"These angry Democrats, when they couldn't get him, went after his *family*!"
1:::Peter Strozk, do not forget, brought down a Russian Spy Ring in the United States.
1:::No.  Tax fraud for the state of New York.  A purely state crime Trump can do nothing about.  Nothing the SC can do about.    Crimes that are *both* state and federal, *maybe* but crimes that are strictly within the State, nothing Trump or the SC can do about it.
1:::Her voice instantly pisses me off. 
1:::I just realized I have never actually heard her or J-Kush speak.  
1:::That’s her public speaking voice dude. You’ve never heard her voice in private conversations. 
1:::I only let them use Trump name because of a very old favor ! They are low energy democrats

1:::Or just two scoops 
1:::To be fair, a traditional catsup made with mushrooms and oysters and such could really make a good steak sauce. Heinz number 57 is sugary gross on a steak.

1:::Oh *dang*, Deng!
1:::Hurts don't it
1:::She pees on the bed and Trump jerks off in the corner?
1:::So Murdoch and Putin are eskimo brothers?  I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
1:::It's been heavily speculated that she's a spy, so there's that.
1:::Yeah, I think she either has a jaw dropping presence, as in walks into a room and all attention is diverted, everyone wants to talk to her and you're the lucky one getting to do so- so huge confidence boost, I've dated women like this and never understood their allure but I was gripped. Or rich old guys are all competing with one another for their "conquests" - as in "Yeah, I'm with Rupert Murdochs ex-wife, she picked me, not you.."   Either way, no shame in her game from me. But it is indicative of her nature. I'd never trust her. I'd assume she was always judging me and after something better. It'd fuck with me hard.
1:::True, I just don't like to get my information from tabloids, they tip the line of gossip too much without relying on facts. plus snopes appears to have debunked this story.      https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ivanka-trump-with-vladimir-putin-and-wendi-murdoch/
1:::Poor Barron. No one gets to pick their parents.

1:::I think bringing his daughter in is the least bad thing he’s done; she seems to be way more sane, and at least actually is his daughter.  But why is jared fucking kushner negotiating on behalf of the fucking united states? How the fuck are republicans okay with this?

1:::Wait! What if that’s the real pee tape? The secret is that it wasn’t prostitutes, it was the First Lady. It gives her a stake in the conspiracy. 
1:::Almost always hiding in the closed dressed like Superman. 
1:::I like her even more. I've been used before... But never for political gain
1:::Like a character from a Bond film
1:::I was 100% wrong about Putin being her 3rd husband. I couldn't find anything corroborating that. When I remembered her name from past news one of the articles had the title of "Wendi Deng Putin" and I didn't read further. So I apologize for that. Removed it from my post. My post was basically me going "Oh, shit, that was that woman I heard about.. let me look her up."  I am more than happy to be proven wrong. Make me think the world is a better place, please.
1:::So I figured you were being sarcastic but I couldn't remember Obama doing that so I looked it up... sure enough he went to Sasha & Malia's soccer games
1:::Imagine being on the other team. The president is actively cheering against me lmao 
1:::Thanks. Looks to me that he was just a really small child and he probably picked up a lot of his mothers Slovene and of her accent. 
1:::Ivanka is a lying criminal scumfuck who believes she's entitled to run shit. 
1:::It's been filtered through an underage Russian prostitute
1:::> yellow Gatorade  I love how you refer to this flavor of Gatorade by its color.  
1:::It's got what plants crave!
1:::This. If you know how to cook a steak and season/marinade it, you don’t need any sauce.  Also depends where you buy your steak. I prefer local butchers compared to chains
1:::Depends on the side and presentation. A cut steak with an old school sauce with oyster, shittake mushrooms, and soy sauce sounds great with some stir fried green beans and peppers. 
1:::Don't get saucy!
1:::You spell "butter" funny.
1:::Thanks! What a glaring oversight on my part. What's it taste like? I'm fat and love food and have found that sauces make foods that aren't terrible for you taste really good. I've been making a lot of my own, but I'm tired and have a slim wife and 2 year old that want delicious food.
1:::Pee Best!
1:::No problem, I understand and thank you for not hating me. I just want to try to keep this place a little more free from rumors. I've seen people here can run away with an idea without checking facts (myself included) and we always have to be careful of rumors, no matter how juicy they may be. Cheers!
1:::And more than once. One quick search gave me two different videos on different days of Obama at the soccer field with his daughter.
1:::Over the last two years, plenty of people have had that feeling.
1:::Yeah I mean I wasn’t implying that it was bad in any way, it just shows he was raised by his mother and not nannies. Also means he didn’t pick up much from his father during those years.
1:::Ew..  +1
1:::This comment, just wow. 
1:::Counterpoint - A1 is yummy. Steak is a good delivery system for A1.   Concession - Put A1 on cheaper cuts.
1:::What kind of sauce do you recommend for marinating a steak in? 
1:::It's atrocious. A1 and HP both destroy it.
