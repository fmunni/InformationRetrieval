23:::The internet is a kinder place these days. Now the most popular gaglinks are like Manning face.
24:::Trump is now corroborating Cohen's plea deal. He says he's allowed to do business during the campaign. Which means he lied repeatedly about his business dealings during the campaign. Uh-oh.
24:::Cohen's pleading guilty means that Jr lied to Congress too. Cohen stated that he briefed the Trump kids on the deal. Jr claimed he had no knowledge of it.

24:::And to clarify, Steele doesn't necessarily believe anything in the dossier to be "true" before being corroborated - all of the information in the dossier was gleaned from an intelligence network comprised of many moving parts and many people with their own skewed perspectives and motives. It was one of the best intelligence networks in the world being utilized by a highly seasoned and skilled intelligence offer so the information is highly accurate, but it's not like Steele had rock solid proof or cold hard facts regarding anything. Just information. So he is definitely happy every time something gets corroborated, too.

And then had your team maintain those lies under oath.  &#x200B;  edit: clarity
27:::Trump on the WH lawn right now.Its fucking hilarious. He's just digging and digging.
27:::By saying "NO NOTHING" he's using a double-negative. The most subtle confession ever.
27:::did anyone else actually see this interview? i dont know if it occurred underneath an active helicopter or what, but holy shit is it prime for parody. he sounded so mad, when you could understand what he was yelling.

27:::I can't wait til they drop all the evidence that corroborates all the lies
27:::They've gotta brainstorm their talking points.
28:::I know we all talk about the movie or HBO miniseries that will come from this, and who will play Mueller, but I think the person who plays Cohen is going to rake in all the awards.  He's the conflicted henchman who TURNED ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.  Holy shit.  Some hot actor is going to gain a bunch of weight and get Cohen's stupid sad look down pat and win an Oscar.
28:::Cohen just linked Trump's business to the Russian government and provided a motive for Trump's cooperation with Russia
28:::MSNBC reporting that donald is now changing his story by saying 'when I was running for president, I was allowed to do business.'
28:::Savage reporter just said "why did you hire Cohen to do your dirty work?!" 
28:::Gotta love Fox's headline: "Mueller squeezes ex-Trump lawyer Cohen to admit lying about Russia real estate deal". He woulda gotten away with it too, if it weren't for Mueller and his meddling squeezing!
28:::Yes.  Mueller was holding everything as close to his vest as possible to keep Trump in the dark.    He just wanted Trump to testify.  Trump not being able to change his story every 5 minutes with impunity will be tough for him.
28:::It brings me no small amount of pleasure to know that Trump (who is so fixated on the loyalty of his lackeys) must be squirming at how much Cohen is collaborating with Mueller and the Special Counsel. Trump’s quote to reporters that Cohen was [“very weak”](https://www-m.cnn.com/2018/11/29/politics/donald-trump-michael-cohen-response/?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) in response to Cohen’s plea deal says it all.

30:::My number one rule in business is *only* hire people smarter than I am. My team gets crap done.
30:::When Mueller was first appointed I didn't know much about.  I knew he had won some major cases and is considered to have been a great FBI director, but that was it.  So I did some research on him.  I spent hours reading everything I could about him.  How he conducts investigations to the cases he has won.  From my research I have concluded that Mueller is smarter than they are.  Not only that, but Mueller has surrounded himself with some of the smartest and best legal minds available.  I do not think Trump or the GOP is capable of preventing him from getting justice for the crimes that have been committed.  They can slow roll as best they can, but they won't prevent it from happening.
30:::Look. If Mueller wouldn't look into it, there'd be nothing to see! So it's clearly his fault, that all these crimes are being uncovered! And the GOP would've gotten away with it too, if it weren't for those meddling lawyers!

Cohen pleaded guilty to material lies related to Trump’s financial dealings involving a Moscow real estate deal during the campaign;  2. Deutsch Bank, Trump’s suspected financial liaison with the Russians was raided this AM; and  3.

32:::Hmm, Matt Whitaker's Twitter is locked:  https://twitter.com/MattWhitaker46  Our acting Attorney General is locking his Twitter account. What a circus we're living in during the Crooked Trump era.
32:::The optics of Whitaker doing anything at all would destroy Trump and make him look guilty as fuck. He's claimed all along it was a fake witch hunt but is clearly flipping out as Mueller is closing in on him. If he wasn't guilty he would just  carry on without any concern. His presidency is effectively over. Whittaker can only inform him of how the end will happen and probably is very aware that he could get pulled down with him.
32:::We won back the house.  We are gonna be fine and we will work our assess off in 2019 and 2020 to get dems in Congress and in the whitehouse. 
32:::Yeah, but Trump showed us all those manilla folders detailing how he was handing over his business to his sons!  Case closed!!!
32:::He just can't help himself.  Either he is that greedy and dumb, or he has to make cash to pay his creditors. Either way, I'm sure it's just dripping with criminality. After all, *who would lend Donald Trump money*?

34:::This would actually be horrible. Then we'd have to spend like 3+ yrs going though airplane rubble. We'd never know what really happened. Think of the conspiracies. People can't even believe Elvis is dead. They won't believe Trump died in a plane crash.

And Donald Trump in return wants to build a hotel in Moscow.  Vlad Putin is trying to literally destroy western democracy and the United States and Donald Trump is trying to make a few million dollars with his shitty hotel.  What a loser.

They did raid his offices, after all -- even stuff that was "new" to the FBI then isn't now.  But even having said that -- that's a *lot of questions*.   No wonder Trump is panicking.
39:::he can't even take a single tough question from a reporter. He either invokes hillary/obama, shouts them down, lies, changes the subject, or abruptly walks away.
40:::*Father NO!*
40:::Ahh, but not just any tower. A tower with the word TRUMP emblazoned on it.
40:::This is something that I've kinda wondered about.  If Trump wanted to stay in office how would be deal with the Secret Service?  They are sworn to protect the Office of the Presidency, not Donnie Moscow.  So as soon as he wasn't a legit President what happens?  I really don't know, I've been wondering.
41:::OMG!!  Trump answered press questions before he leaves for G20 and holy shit did he admit to the Trump Moscow business deals...  His lawyers must be going crazy.
41:::Napolitano on Fox: "I've never seen a defendant plead guilty who wanted to tell the court *more* than they had to. This is the tip of an iceberg."  Watching Fox is kind of a pleasure right now.   They're beyond spin at the moment, they're just holding on for dear life.

It adds one more felony to those Cohen has already taken, with no real marginal effect.  It will have an extremely negligible effect, IF ANY, on his sentence.  So why bother?  >Well, normally a federal prosecutor WOULDN'T bother with a plea that has no impact.  But here, the impact is telling the story of the investigation as a whole, and promoting the case that the entire Trump Organization was lying about its degree of involvement with Russia.    this supports the theory that the “Mueller report” will actually be told through court filings and guilty pleas as opposed to an actual book with chapters like Starr’s report

As you can see, Mueller has been extraordinarily productive in a relatively short period—belying Donald's "witch hunt" claims.   Donald has never been investigated by someone who works consistently and methodically, follows the leads, and isn't the least bit interested in cutting a corrupt deal with him (unlike with his friend [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article214210674.html )).   Donald might *actually* be held accountable.

44:::This has been known for a long time.   Cohen and represented another former RNC chairman turned GOP fundraiser (more than 600 million) for a hush money payment to another porn star.  And the same lawyer who represented this porn star was Stormy Daniels original lawyer before Avanetti, Keith Davidson.

45:::I'm at a tire shop right now and they've got Fox news on the TV. I'm absolutely blown away by the entirely different reality these guys live on.  They're simultaneously talking about how close Cohen was to Trump, how terrible Cohen is, and that Trump put in place "Brilliant attorney Rudy Gulliani" to give peace and stability to this whole process to prevent impeachment.  Reality is going to blindside all of these guys like a brick wall.
45:::>["Helsinki was a significant turning point, as he worried about the future of our country with the president of the United States aligning with somebody who everybody in his intelligence community who he appointed, including [Director of National Intelligence] Dan Coats, said that Putin interfered and tried to help Trump get elected," Davis said.

And that shook up Mr. Cohen."](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/22/michael-cohen-trump-lanny-davis-helsinki-791359)  Even with all the crimes and despicable acts that Cohen had committed with Trump, it's crazy to think that he still didn't understand quite how far Trump would be willing to take things until right at the end.

46:::> Since entering his guilty pleas in Manhattan, Cohen has been talking with multiple agencies investigating the president, sources said. He is doing so voluntarily, without the protection of a formal cooperation agreement or the specific promise of a reduced sentence.  > “His cooperation has already created the most serious federal allegations to date concerning President Trump, and more may be coming,” Coffey said.      Trump is so unbelievably fucked when this all eventually comes crashing down on him.       A democratic house is going to put a TON of pressure on him and once he's voted out and impeached I wouldn't be surprised if they make an example of him and send him to prison.       He'd basically be in 24/7 solitary since he'd be in in danger around other prisoners. His demnetia would finally consume him after being locked up and alone for who knows how long and he would maybe even forget his own presidency, a mercy the rest of us will not have. 
47:::You know how many people Mueller can get on lying to Congress now?  Don Jr  Kushner  Stone  Prince   And on and on
47:::Oh, this would infuriate him. It's perfect.
47:::That legitimately doesn't seem easy for him to pull off. He has security details sticking to him like a glove at all times who'd stop him from running  and his pilots are high ranking military officers who aren't gonna just fly off with him- unlike somebody like Roger Stone, I don't see how he could hop on a private plane and skate to Russia.
48:::Someone needs to get ahead of the game for the swag that should be sold after this is all over.  Someone design a T-shirt that has just a minimalist outline of Mueller's jawline and haircut profile, then under it use the same layout and font as Trump's propaganda that says "Made America Great Again".  I'd buy that shit in an instant.
48:::That would be a fantastic movie from the 90s

If one of them took a stand against Donnie now and made a serious statement on the floor calling for him to resign, they could become the new leader of the party. Ain't holding my breath, just saying there's an opportunity here, if only there were a single principaled or even wise opportunist    rat on this derailing Trump train. It would be a movie moment. Oscar worthy. "How dare you Mr President!" Etc
50:::Indictment here - https://www.lawfareblog.com/document-michael-cohen-criminal-information-mueller-probe
50:::Yup, this is their defense angle now.  People are being "forced to lie" to take plea deals that implicate Trump in crimes.
50:::If that’s true that might be the most baller thing about Mueller so far. 
50:::I've never seen Trump worried about optics...
50:::That's the beauty of doublethink, it isn't any harder to believe the big lie than the small one. In fact in many cases it's easier. Knowing it's a lie and instantly making it the truth instead is the *point* of it all.
50:::Unless he convinces the Secret Service to play along with his coup, they would likely arrest him for being on the White House grounds or Air Force 1 without permission, because according to the constitution he simply isn't president anymore. It'd be like a bum who snuck in and started role-playing president.
51:::Looks like we were both right:  > A few months later, in May 2017, Cohen decided to share more. BuzzFeed News asked to see the inside of his passport, so he showed it to Anthony Cormier, a reporter for the site. The provided passport revealed just one trip inside the Schengen Area — to Italy, in July, which doesn’t quite match the timeline laid out in the dossier. Cohen claimed to them that this was his only passport. And for several months afterward, that is where things remained.  >Now, the new McClatchy report by Stone and Gordon claims Mueller has evidence that Cohen “secretly made a late-summer trip to Prague.” They write that, per their anonymous sources, “investigators have traced evidence that Cohen entered the Czech Republic through Germany, apparently during August or early September of 2016, as the ex-spy reported.”  https://www.vox.com/2018/4/13/17236660/michael-cohen-prague-trump-steele-dossier
52:::EVERYTHING is projection with them. Everything.

67:::It is majorly net positive. I was worried about how I phrased it being interpreted like this, so let me clarify: I meant that Trump keeps exaggerating the number because he's currently scared shitless and is falling back on the only thing he knows how to do: lie and exaggerate.

71:::As a Canadian, although out of any nation we're the most impacted if things truly go sideways in the USA, this legal drama has been something to behold.  Is it just me or is the timeline exponentially speeding up? I'm buckling in for an intense next 3 months. Trump's meltdowns are getting worse as he feels cornered.  Even with the +40 blue wave in the House (thank God, I think something liek 75% of Canadians would likely vote Democrat given the state of your politics with the GOP), things are going to get worse, potentially much worse, before they get better.  His psychology is so blatantly clear. He's a pathetic weak animal who feels caged with the walls closing in. He's going to continue to lash out more aggressively.  Here's to hoping your institutions hold up and the SCOTUS has some level of legitimacy left.
71:::Just listening to the report from in the court on MSNBC. First time Trump has been named in open court. Also, Moscow discussions went into 2017, and Michael Cohen discusses going to Moscow in 2017.   As Stephanie Ruhle put it, “Holy Cannoli!”  Edit: Spelling. (Thanks my friend, for correcting me in a totally non-douchy way) 
71:::Actually this appears to be a surprise to almost everyone,  including donnie. His tweets up until this hearing were almost entirely a reaction to the Manafort news and the implication he failed his take home test.    This may trigger a whole new batch of rage. Hold on to your butts!
71:::Never ask questions you don't know the answers to.  Trump was so screwed on the take home test and his attorneys knew it, they all knew it.  Every single question on there was either lying to the grand jury or confessing.

135:::[Erica Orden](https://twitter.com/eorden/status/1068158530459451392):  >Cohen: “I made these statements to be consistent with Individual-1’s political messaging and to be loyal to Individual-1,” Cohen said in court.  Presumably, Individual 1 is Trump. 
135:::I hope we don't let his supporters off the hook like we did when they supported GWB. They've been so rabid in their support of Trump. They can't act like they never did while their MAGA hat collects dust in the closet. 
135:::Yea and he just incriminated himself admitting he was considering doing the deal but backed out. He still admitted to trying to do it!!
135:::And some of the more "historical" ones were erected in the 1920s during the resurrection of the KKK.
136:::I feel like shit's about to go from 0 to 100 real quick. I read Special Counsel filings with the court today. A senior official from the Trump campaign at the time, labeled as individual 2 in documents, arranged a meeting for Cohen at Davos with either the Prime Minister of Russia or Putin. What I get from this is the  Trump campaign had back channel communications with senior Russian officials and directly coordinated with them. No collusion? 
138:::Could be Trump just being his asshole self and rushing back to catch the start of Hannity.
139:::Sealed Indictments. 
143:::Nicolle Wallace just made a good point on Twitter. Mueller speaks through documents, Micheal Cohen, Paul Manafort and Jerome Corsi just got caught lying-who is this message too? Don JR?Kushner? Bannon?   All of the above. 
143:::Thank you, for some reason I thought the previous plea deal was with Mueller and was confused why there were two separate deals. 
144:::Same color as the frogs, hmm
145:::I'd be more willing to crowdfund a legal challenge to just get rid of those silly FCC rules for language, personally.  
147:::We had our elections.  Wasn't it common knowledge that absolutely nothing was supposed to happen for ....60, I think, days before Election Day?  It's all backed up, like a clogged pipe, because of this.   The near future promises to be one of intrigue and chaos as these pipes open back up for their intended purposes.
149:::Hey, relevant news breaking on Twitter. The office of the guy whose law firm did Trump's taxes for a decade is maybe being raided by the Feds right now: https://twitter.com/renato_mariotti/status/1068181852001890304?s=19
153:::Hi, Sean Hannity. 
153:::They've passed SSJ3.  Trump has an Ultra Instinct for always choosing the wrong action.  He doesn't even think about it, he just reacts.
155:::Fuck Donald Trump
156:::It'd make sense on Xmas eve or something where they know people aren't going to go out protesting over the following days and won't be watching the news as closely. 
158:::I’m sure Mueller has a dead mans switch in place in case he is fired.
161:::So we know he has Trump on *at least* two counts of **written** perjury right now.
161:::Trump Tower seized and boarded up.  No remaining piece of real estate anywhere in the country bearing his name.  It will be wiped out.  
162:::Yeah this is exactly what will happen then in 10 to 20 years a lot of those people will die off and schools will teach this moment to kids who won't be able to believe anyone bought Trump's bullshit.  
168:::It's just a vehicle for money laundering, similar to his Florida property that another Russian oligarch overpayed for a few years ago. 
172:::Lol trump is losing it on live tv right now
176:::I’m shocked beyond belief 
180:::It's my birthday today. Thank you Mr. Mueller😌
180:::[Clint Watts](https://twitter.com/selectedwisdom/status/1068161433869983749):  >From the Cohen Criminal Information, important to note that Cohen's plea today comes after the President submitted his written answers to Special Counsel Mueller.
184:::You mean Trump a year after he was President was still working on that deal?!
184:::Holy fuck. Trump has been roasted on a spit
188:::I wish we knew more about this. Trump is a sitting duck.  
189:::They had Dershowitz on and he point blank said that all of these crimes (edit: perjury) occurred after the Mueller investigation began conveniently omitting all the crimes that Manafort was convicted for. 
191:::Weird, I thought he said he didn't have any projects in Russia.   But then he didn't.   But then he did.   And then he didnt.   Narrator: ***He Did***
192:::This is the time to photograph your neighbors Trump yard sign. It will make an excellent framed photo gift later 
195:::Where we're going, we don't need Mooches.
204:::And the fact that he was Trump's personal fixer for a decade. There's certainly no shortage of leads Mueller will have to go on.   If Trump was smart he'd resign but I have a feeling he will hang on and take the GOP out with him.
205:::Read the docs. Implicates Don Jr. or Ivanka too!
205:::Coffee lawyer...
205:::It means Cohen has been singing like a canary.
210:::Not boarded up, made into public housing for refugees. 
211:::Stand by for the firing of Mueller during Christmas recess...
211:::"Sentencing and other related matters" - should be interesting because everything with Manafort gets entered into the public record.  Trump should just resign now because he's fucked no matter what. 
213:::I assume he's referencing the emoluments clause. 
213:::Don't forget that Mueller brought down John Gotti and the Mob. He's honestly a national hero.
215:::Protestmas. 
219:::I hope he does. I hope that whole rotten house burns to the ground. I hope the ones who are really in deep start running away with all their money too. So we know they are guilty. And I hope we start running them down and bringing them home to stand trial, just like the Nazis that ran to South America after WW2. The only way America fully recovers any sort of reputation with the international community is if the Republican party is made an example of after all of this. No immunity, no back room deals, no too big to fail bullshit. If any of them are guilty of a crime, they need to go to jail.
221:::Wait, they spent 90 million dollars?  E: My assessment was way off, 1.43 billion dollars is a wild amount to spend on an investigation
223:::We.. Wish you a Mueller Christmas, we wish you a Mueller Christmas, we wish you a Mueller Christmas, and Trumpgret New Year! 
223:::So much fresh KREAM today!  r/ShitPoppinKreamSays/
224:::They already are.
225:::Although Cohen is a complete snake, I'm glad he had the intelligence to take the plea deal and help bring down Trump as it is fully and wholly deserved.
225:::Lordy, that one felt good to read.
231:::100%. Literally siphoning the world's wealth and stashing it amongst themselves. 
232:::Holy fucking handbaskets to hell. 
234:::When the Clinton-style testimony comes, I can’t wait for them to read tweets like this and see him say “that depends on your definition of ‘nothing’”. 
242:::Or it can go down in history as the Christmas Day Protest. A night to remember forever!
247:::>  "Cohen didn't go to Prague  except he probably did.  He flew to Italy within the Prague meeting time frame.  He didn't have to get his passport stamped to travel within the EU.
249:::This president is so compromised it's unbelievable. He is so dumb that he continued with these deals with Russia while the investigation was ongoing. My jaw is on the floor.
252:::Stupid Watergate SSJ3
253:::Everyone on r/conservative is screeching about how this was a process crime and has nothing to do with Trump or Russia.  A real estate deal between Trump and Russia has nothing to do with Trump and Russia.  They literally cannot connect the dots.
254:::Not even F5 Friday!
255:::My grandfather's name was Robert, giving me an easy excuse to tell my family that's why I picked it for my eventual son's middle name. But I'll know the real reason. 
259:::They'll say it's a Deep State setup and Trump is above board in everything he does. All the charges against him are bogus and he is being framed to garner support in implementing a New World Order. 
260:::Trump to be officially named in court. No longer “Individual 1.”   Ive been keeping my “This is it!” impulses in check, but this seems like a massive escalation. 
260:::Coupled with the Manafort lies and the submission of the take home test, we are now in the final phase.
261:::When Manafort broke his plea deal, the estate put aside for his family became open game. It's around 45 million. And yes, we were already in the black with the 20 mil. Last time I saw a report late summer, the investigation was only at $13 mil. 
262:::“As long as Hillary isn’t president, I don’t give a fuck who Trump colluded with.”  A comment I just saw on the Conservative sub. I’m disgusted by the fact that some of these people would rather have a president who illegally stole an election instead of a Democrat.
262:::Thanks!  Edit: I think there has been some confusion. We know the Trump Tower Moscow venture continued into the summer of 2016, following the RNC Convention. Cohen lied to Congress during his 2017 Congressional hearing claiming that the venture had ended before the RNC Convention. Here's the tweet from NBC that caused the confusion.^[[1]](https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/1068156555101650945?s=21)
267:::loophole, no perjury, he was telling the truth all along
272:::Thank you that someone else noticed this. He's literally increased his claimed cost of the Mueller probe by $10MIL every time he's mentioned it over the last four days.
278:::Allowed by who?
282:::MSNBC just said Trump is changing his story saying "Just because I'm running for president doesn't mean I can no longer do business"  Ruh roh
283:::'Tis the season
283:::That's almost enough mooches to send a DeLorean back in time a full 10 days!
291:::Manafort sentencing hearing tomorrow
292:::[removed]
293:::>former RNC finance chairman  This is gonna be tasty.  
295:::100% definitely, yes. "My trip before Cleveland. [Individual 1] once he becomes the nominee after the convention."
304:::400 Gajillion DOLLARS SPENT ON THIS WITCH HUNT!!!! 
305:::This canary is singing a long long song
306:::Wait, deutche got raided?!
306:::indeed https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46382722?fbclid=IwAR3Z2mkJ-4G88VdsyF3C0zToMJ0hd3BxKbd8lkLQ73_Kph79GkkIMhRuMzY
307:::Great summary - thank you!
309:::[Natasha Bertrand](https://twitter.com/NatashaBertrand/status/1068150501022289921):  >AP reports that Cohen will plead guilty to lying to Congress about the Trump Moscow real estate deal. This is what Cohen told Congress about that proposal in his opening statement:  >>I assume we will discuss the rejected proposal to build a Trump property in Moscow that was terminated in January of 2016; which occurred before the Iowa caucus and months before the very first primary. This was solely a real estate deal and nothing more. I was doing my job. I would ask that the two-page statement about the Moscow proposal that I sent to the Committee in August be incorporated into and attached to this transcript.
316:::Do you know why the White House is one of the friendliest places?   Everyone you meet says "Pardon me"
316:::>No, so far the only "false" statement was he miss-spelled "alfa" as "alpha"   And that can be attributed to no definite translation.
316:::Protestivus for the rest of us
321:::Michael Cohen is the Ray Liotta of this story. 
334:::Would explain the shitstorm of tweets from Donald this week 
335:::No. In Russia he becomes a valuable propaganda tool, to be trotted out by Russia Today and rail against the "Deep State" that deposed him. He dies in jail.
336:::BREAKING: Trump calls ex-lawyer Michael Cohen a `weak person' after new guilty plea, claims he's lying to get a reduced sentence.  https://twitter.com/ap/status/1068165600143388674?s=21  Lmfao *someone’s* shitting his pants with fear
339:::"I just wanted Pence in there.  He's a true conservative!  Trump was just a  reality tv star that could get out the vote, yada yada yada.  Now candidate Ted Nugent? YES!  he's the real deal!!!"
344:::And the vast majority of Confederate statues weren't erected during the Civil War, they were erected in the 1950s and 60s to scare black people during the Civil Rights Era.  Edit: Also, many of them were built in the early 1900s during the Jim Crow Era and at the behest of the Daughters of the Confederacy. Thanks to the users below for pointing this out.
352:::Mueller actually gained 20 something million from Manafort as well. We might be in the positives here.
359:::Explains Donny's panic attack after a phone call while attending the WH Christmas Tree lighting ceremony last night. 
361:::While we’re waiting for all the details, [here’s one part of Cohen’s testimony that we know for sure is false:](https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1068150664566636545?s=21)  > I’m very proud to have served Donald J. Trump for all these years, and I’ll continue to support him.
365:::Its.fucking.happening. 
367:::Like the Air Force colonel that flies the plane wouldn’t tell him to fuck off.
369:::I want to see a bunch of fat cats fall for what we learned from the Panama Papers. To be clear, that involves the ludicrously rich from the world over, including politicians and heads of state the world over.
376:::I see the confederate flag brought up and usually I just overlook it but I want to mention something. The confederate flag that is known today is the confederate war flag, not the actual flag used for the confederacy. The confederate war flag has only started being widely used in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There was no "heritage not hate" because there is no heritage with this flag, it is a symbol of hate.
393:::I always had the feeling that him defecting on AF1 would be the final chapter of this horrible telenovela.  Do we let Russia keep the plane as long as they don’t let Trump come back?
402:::This explains the manic tweets about the “Witch Hunt.” He’s freaking out. 
403:::Magic 8-Ball says: "It is decidedly so."
409:::Honestly, I don't think his base is even paying attention to any of this, they are all just busy riling each other up over immigrants.
411:::Sen. Warner: "There seems to be a trend here among the president's closest allies...**that they don't tell the truth.**" 
419:::Eh this needs updated. He was working on Trump Tower Moscow until **August 2017**.  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2018/nov/29/us-politics-michael-cohen-live-updates?page=with:block-5bfff7b7e4b0de80e896f053#block-5bfff7b7e4b0de80e896f053  *updated link 
423:::Always remember:  a very brave journalist died to get this information into the public domain.   She should be celebrated with a global holiday. 
439:::ehh i think he probably understands how complicated an investigation into such a wide-ranging, multinational conspiracy is.
444:::How the fuck does Trump even function at this point? 
445:::More importantly, the Congress with 40 new Democratic house members.
457:::I just watched a blonde lady on Fox say that although the President says there's nothing wrong with this Moscow Trump Tower deal even if they did go through with it, if there's nothing wrong, why are so many people lying about it and covering it up.  L. O. L.
461:::Shit.  Putin is having a bad day too. I 100% expect an escalation in the Ukrainian conflict. 
470:::Stupid fake dossier always being 100% factual! 
472:::Does he? Seems like he does about as much as any other resident in an old folks home.  Any resident deeply involved in a criminal conspiracy, I mean.
474:::“In the hopes of limiting the ongoing Russian investigations”.....that’s obstruction. Let’s play ball!
481:::For those who don't understand why 3 January is important, the [20th Amendment of the Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxx) gives 3 January as the day Congress opens.
487:::Never mind the decade + he worked for Trump beforehand.
500:::Nah, they’ll pretend they never supported him to begin with. When your values are non existent it’s easier to lie to yourself. 
502:::January 3, 2019 can't come soon enough
517:::Honestly, I think him defecting to Russia on Air Force One would go a long way to deprogramming a lot of his base.
524:::I'd be just as happy with his self-imposed exile to Russia, with his assets frozen so none of his family can benefit from them, and a standing extradition order with each of our allies around the world.  You like Russia so much? Go there and stay there, you piece of crap!
530:::How is this anything other than blatant propaganda? Lies under oath are lies under oath... it doesn't matter if the person lying is someone you support. 
533:::In a few years they will all pretend they never supported Trump, much the way they pretend they never supported Bush Jr. They will just move on to supporting another incompetent leader with no learning or self awareness. 
540:::Thank you Kanye. Very cool!
565:::>”Michael Cohen briefed Trump family memebers on the dealing with Russia and Trump tower Moscow. “ CNN   Does anybody know if JR lied to Congress about this too? 
572:::<in the background, whispers>  "No no, leave that! I told you we weren't taking any of it!" 
577:::Kream status = popped
600:::The Liar-in-Chief, everyone. He's so fucking going down. I'm a little worried how some Republicans will react to the news when he is finally taken away. Their bubble crashing down on them is gonna make a huge mess.
602:::Imagine it is true and Steele is confident in it, he must be slamming his head on the desk and saying "no shit!" to every revealation we make in our slow moving process
617:::A fucking tower. That’s the real scandal. Our elections were sold to our most dangerous enemy for a fucking tower, dudes.   Edit: a word  Edit another; typing on phone is hard. Covfefe
618:::Fox’s lead story is about a convict serial killer who is a black man. Red meat for their base.  Edit: After reading more about the story I admit that this story is, in fact, news. But it’s useful news, for Fox News.
626:::Watching the coverage on Fox News is amazing. All they're focusing on is the "perjury trap" aspect and not the crimes. 
638:::Fuck me right in the orange 
641:::Narrator: *He did have deals, loans, and real estate in Russia.*
665:::Cohen named individual 1 as being Donald Trump. 
667:::Ouch.   Too bad tweets aren’t perjourous. 
676:::~~FUCKING **AUGUST** OF 2017!~~  Edit: Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I regret to inform you that I was mistaken. I heard from multiple sources both online and off that it was August, however, it seems that date hasn't been substantiated. You must take back your karma and refrain from giving me more. If I am given gold I'll just spend it on a cute pair of shoes that don't even fit me so it will be a waste anyway.   So, how about we split the difference and say that Trump is a large, orange, wet pile of shit, no matter when he was talking about business dealings in Russia, fair?
686:::Michael Cohen? Never met him.
691:::Also what Maddow and others have posited: he's going to use court proceedings to publicize information that Whitaker would have otherwise tried to suppress.      For example, the Manafort proceedings. Mueller can include a lot of information/evidence in his court filings against people like Manafort or Cohen, and there's nothing Whitaker can do to stop that or suppress it.
713:::Remember, to his base, it only matters what he's saying today.  That's the only truth they need.  Who cares what he said yesterday?  That's in the past.  It was truth when it was said, but it has since been superseded by today's new truth.  Listen to what he says today.  Most honest politician of all time! 
716:::True, but if they're investigating Deutsche Bank in regards to money laundering I would imagine there to be some interesting overlap, even if they're prioritizing the Panama papers.   Tbh tho I think I might be more excited about seeing headway on PP by a government authority, that's almost the head of the snake imo. Felt like it got swept under the rug for a minute there and hopefully we start seeing more action. 
717:::Cohen in Court today: "I made these statements to be consistent with Individual-1’s political messaging and to be loyal to Individual-1.”  Cohen also acknowledged that he "had a 20-minute conversation with a spokesman for the Kremlin."
723:::I thought Mueller's team said recently that they know Whitaker was appointed, and they don't care because it won't effect them. That makes me think they planned ahead and their sealed indictments will take care of themselves if any funny business happens.  Edit: as commenters have pointed out, they said Whitakers appointment didn't effect the special counsel's authority, they haven't said anything about the investigation as a whole.
757:::He just named Trump in open court.
763:::Has any of it actually been proven to be false yet? 
767:::Mueller will be remembered in the halls of history for being called on steering our nation through stormy seas once again.   He steered us through the wake of 9/11, and now when his country needed him once more, he rose from retirement like Jack Ryan.  A Red Don will never rise.  
777:::"Individual 1" is Donald Trump, I presume?
827:::What's funny is I just went through his tweets and two days ago he claimed the special counsel has spent 30 million and then two days later he upped it to 40 million. I personally don't care how much it costs but I find it amusing he adjusts the numbers on the fly.
849:::No nothing = something, technically!
873:::That’s how criminal enterprises collapse; none of them have any integrity so when shit hits the fan it’s every man for himself and they start squealing and pointing fingers. It’s not honorable, it is predictable and exploitable.
876:::>There's no way out and he knows it.  Scarily, the only way out is for him to rile up his base even more to the boiling point, or escape on a plane to Russia 
918:::What about then getting caught at the airport and sent to prison. I think I’d take a day off work to celebrate. 
962:::Re: FN 18: Trump’s 1/10/17 tweet denying he has any business with Russia— that’s interesting, b/c NBC reporting ~~**Cohen admitting that discussions on Trump Moscow continued into 2017.**~~  Edit: [sauce](https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/1068156555101650945?s=21).   Edit 2: maybe not? [There seems to have been an error in some of the live-tweeting suggesting the deal went thru August 2017, when that's when Cohen submitted his testimony to Congress.](https://twitter.com/emptywheel/status/1068154403058827266?s=21)   Edit 3: thanks, kind redditor. I shall take this silver and buy MouseCaller below exactly ONE cute shoe that doesn’t fit with my trinket. 
1037:::Don’t forget that Alan Weisselberg, Trump Org CFO was granted immunity by SDNY! We’re in the end-game now.  Edited the details of his immunity deal, it was with SDNY, not the SC.
1049:::Lol! Trump was still trying to do Moscow deals even after special counsel investigation started. The sheer stupidity.   This is beyond Stupid Watergate. 
1054:::And the new "dunce cap" in pop culture. 
1065:::Meanwhile at Fox News: "Does romaine lettuce make you gay?" 
1105:::[John Santucci on Twitter:](https://twitter.com/Santucci/status/1068164706375008256)  >**NEW - President Trump was asked about the Trump Tower Moscow project among a list of written questions by special counsel Robert Mueller, sources familiar with the president’s responses tell @ABC News.   No details about his response.**  Mueller got you, you fuck.
1106:::Nothing would satisfy me more than watching trump run
1111:::Boy, it has been a eventful one for sure.   &#x200B;  Corsi admits to a bunch of stuff last night.    Deutsche Bank HQ got raided for the Panama Papers  Now Michael Cohen is pleading guilty to this and still cooperating with the Special Counsel?  &#x200B;  I have a feeling a big bloated orange baby is going to have a terrible holiday season and beyond.
1136:::We don't know what's going on with whitaker behind the scenes or what he was tasked with. It's possible trump just wants him to leak info and not stop anything or it's possible he's been made powerless in some way and it just isn't public knowledge. 
1142:::This week has felt like a year.  How has so much stuff happened and it's only Thursday?!
1162:::The Guardian is reporting:  >Per what’s being read in the courtroom, Michael Cohen apparently had conversations about a potential Trump real estate project in Moscow as recently as August, 2017.  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2018/nov/29/us-politics-michael-cohen-live-updates  Edit: More clarity from the Guardian link above: > Cohen told the court that he lied about his conversations with Trump about a real estate deal in Moscow.  and  > Cohen’s guilty plea apparently involves lies about efforts to pursue the project into 2017 when Trump was President.  Edit 2: Here is what [the Steele Dossier has to say about Trump and real estate deals in Russia](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html):  > The Kremlin’s cultivation operation on TRUMP also had comprised offering him various lucrative real estate development business deals in Russia, especially in relation to the ongoing 2018 World Cup soccer tournament, However, so far, for reasons unknown, TRUMP had not taken up any of these  (page 2)  and  > TRUMP's previous efforts had included exploring real estate sector in St. Petersburg as well as Moscow but in the end TRUMP had had to settle for the use of extensive sexual services there from local prostitutes rather than business success  (page 8)  Edit 3: The Special Counsel's Office has posted the plea agreement and criminal information document (1:18-cr-850) on their website now: https://www.justice.gov/sco  Thanks for the Reddit gold!
1194:::They aren't written under oath, but they are "official statements of the President" that could help to establish intent.
1237:::That's apparently related to the Panama Papers, not Trump. I mean they're still total scumbags, but they're equal-opportunity scumbags.
1246:::70 hours?? Considering how he was the RNC deputy finance chair and hannity's lawyer, the entire right wing political sphere must be shitting their pants on what Cohen may have given up
1251:::This WEEK:  * Mueller claims Manafort violated his plea deal * Manafort's lawyer's briefed Trump post-plea deal (JDF) * Corsi declines a guilty plea, admits illegality and says he's ready to die in prison * Reports surface Manafort met with Assange in March, 2016 * Trump says Rosenstein should be behind bars b/c he appointed a special counsel * Cohen pleads to guilty to lying about Trump-Russia financial dealings  **and it's MOTHER FUCKING THURSDAY AT 9:00am**  EDITED to add more from the comments:  * We learned campaign members contacted Psy Group, and Mueller has it in his crosshairs * Reports surface Roger Stone had direct access to Trump, actively contacted WikiLeaks repeatedly & explicitly told colleagues WikiDump details before the fact * All this, and STILL **Senate Republicans block vote on Mueller protection bill** * Deutche Bank raided again for money laundering (although that focus is on the Panama Papers) * Manafort sentencing hearing tomorrow
1329:::There should be no confusion  &#x200B;  This confirms there was collusion  &#x200B;  Trump is freaking for a reason  &#x200B;  That dumb fuck committed treason
1388:::Steele was an agent for MI6 for over 20 years.  He was even the head of the Russian desk for MI6.  This guy is probably one of the top intelligence officers/spies in the world.  He probably has informants/connections that go all the way up the chain in Russia.  With that kind of background, I'm inclined to believe everything he discovered.  
1426:::We’d crowdfund the FCC fine for that.
1464:::No, so far the only "false" statement was he miss-spelled "alfa" as "alpha"   But it's important to know there WILL be things that Steel got wrong. He's going to have the wrong fine details in some cases, but the larger story is what counts. Don't get hung up on "Cohen didn't go to Prague, it's all fake!" when really he went to some other city instead. Getting those details wrong is expected. 
1508:::Exactly.  He pardons Cohen and Manafort...so what?  Congress WILL subpoena those fuckwits.  And accepting a pardon, you admit guilt and can't lie anymore.  He's fucked. There's no way out and he knows it.
1562:::Their MAGA caps will be the new Confederate flag.
1579:::I know Cohen only flipped to save his ass and wants to be remembered as a good person, but, I kind of like him being a smart ass and a thorn in Trump’s side.   He’s like a necessary evil. 
1587:::100% guarantee Trump lied about Trump Tower Moscow in his written responses   ETA: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/us/politics/questions-mueller-wants-to-ask-trump-russia.html  > What communication did you have with Michael D. Cohen, Felix Sater and others, including foreign nationals, about Russian real estate developments during the campaign?  ETA 2: https://twitter.com/Santucci/status/1068164706375008256  > @Santucci NEW - President Trump was asked about the Trump Tower Moscow project among a list of written questions by special counsel Robert Mueller, sources familiar with the president’s responses tell @ABC News.   No details about his response.
1598:::Weird, Fox News only refers to him as Trumps former attorney, not also his close friend and former RNC finance chairman.   Edit: Trump also called him “not a very smart person” yet... retained him for a decade to handle his legal affairs?

1895:::Yep, between yesterday's news and this, I wonder how badly Trump perjured himself on those questions.
1903:::I have to wonder if they told him that over speaker phone while packing their bags and making sure their plane tickets were on hand.  "Yes, sir.  It will ALL be over by Christmas."
2018:::ALSO, Guiliani JUST contradicts Trump.  At 11ish: Trump\~ Cohen is lying now to save his skin. His testimony in front of Congress was true.  Guiliani just now (and no bullshit): \~ Of course Cohen lied in front of Congress. THAT'S what he does. He lies all the time!

2647:::Fox is live at the courthouse.  The reporter on scene said someone asked Michael Cohen what he thought was going to happen as he came down the courthouse steps.  Cohen's response was apparently, "what do you think is going to happen?"  Beautiful.

(Dossier, pp. 18, 30, 32, 34–35) * "COHEN now was heavily engaged in a cover up and damage limitation operation in the attempt to prevent the full details of TRUMP's relationship with Russia being exposed." (Dossier, p. 32)  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump–Russia\_dossier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump–Russia_dossier)  More:  [Here's the criminal information PDF.](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5331441/Cohen-False-Statements-Criminal-Information.pdf):  On it, *\[Russian Official 1\]* is **Dmitry Peskov** (explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/a1htyo/megathread_michael_cohen_pleads_guilty_to_lying/eaq96cf/)), and says Cohen "received an email from the personal assistant to Russian Official 1 (“Assistant 1”), stating that she had been trying to reach COHEN and requesting that he call her using a Moscow-based phone number she provided."  Peskov in the dossier:  >The Clinton dossier had been collated by the FSB and was managed by Dmitry Peskov, Putin's press secretary.

5787:::Cohen lied about Trump Moscow Tower to Congress;  **Earlier this year Buzzfeed News released an in depth article about the Trump Moscow Tower project.^[[1]](https://www.buzzfeed.com/anthonycormier/trump-moscow-micheal-cohen-felix-sater-campaign?utm_term=.sdJPjVvDQ#.brn0gx7GW) We learned that Michael Cohen lied to lawmakers in Congress when he claimed to have ended the venture in early 2016. The Trump Moscow Tower project continued into the summer of 2016.^[[2]](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/former-trump-attorney-michael-cohen-pleads-guilty-lying-congress-n941616)  Moreover, they worked on the venture when then candidate Trump was close to securing the GOP presidential nomination in 2016. Candidate Trump promoted Paul Manafort to Campaign Chairman around this time to corral delegates at the GOP convention, it was at this stage of the campaign where Trump  began to publicly change his policy towards Ukraine and Russia.^[[3]](https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-changed-views-on-ukraine-after-hiring-paul-manafort-campaign-manager-russia-vladimir-putin/) Felix Sater, a long time business associate of the President that was working on this project with his childhood friend Michael Cohen, was in contact with a former GRU officer during the duration of the venture.^[[4]](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jasonleopold/donald-trump-russian-spy-moscow-gru-felix-sater?utm_term=.swea0nJPjn#.va7GjNanbN)**  *Expanded explanation:*  President Trump has made innumerable denials about doing any business with Russia. Yet he signed a letter of intent to build a Moscow Trump Tower in 2015.^[[5]](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tower-moscow-letter-of-intent-2017-9) Moreover, President Trump tried to do business with a sanctioned Russian bank in 2016.^[[6]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/15/trump-organization-negotiated-with-sanctioned-russian-bank-in-2016?CMP=twt_gu)  Felix Sater wanted to work with the Russians to help get Trump elected by showcasing Trump's negotiation skills, to do this he wanted to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. The New York Times^[[7]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/us/politics/trump-tower-putin-felix-sater.html?_r=0) story is corroborated by the Washington Post.^[[8]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-company-had-more-contact-with-russia-during-campaign-according-to-documents-turned-over-to-investigators/2017/10/02/2091fe5e-a6c0-11e7-850e-2bdd1236be5d_story.html?utm_term=.f61662df4652) President Trump signed a letter of intent to build the Moscow Trump Tower during the campaign.^[[9]](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-knew-moscow-tower-proposal-campaign-lawyer/story?id=49472342)  New information on the relationship between Felix Sater and Trump has come to light.

Moreover, in July of 2016 we know he attended a secret meeting at Trump Tower.^[[12]](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-russia-felix-sater-227434)  Months ago there it was reported that Felix Sater was ready to cooperate with Special Counsel Mueller.^[[13]](https://www.rawstory.com/2017/08/longtime-trump-business-partner-told-family-he-knows-he-and-potus-are-going-to-prison-report/) Paul Wood, World Affairs correspondent for the BBC, wrote the original article for The Spectator.^[[14]](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/08/forget-charlottesville-russia-is-still-the-true-trump-scandal/) Back in the 90's Felix Sater was caught up in a massive stock scam and flipped on mob families in New York.
