-2:::Gab is full of too many legit racist POS.
0:::I just had my account locked, after posting tweets defending Laura Loomer.  I hadn‚Äôt been in twitter for 8 hours, got on, posted two tweets then locked for unspecified violations.  They are triggering on her name, trying to suppress discussion.
0:::Liberals will continue to expose themselves.
0:::Or even internet interaction, but by direct discussion, not by "following" and "liking" and "trending" and "tweeting" and "retweeting".
0:::i agree, but abandoning social media isn't going to do the right any favors. memes and social media are playing bigger parts in our elections day by day, for better or worse. and there's no stopping it.
0:::Yes I know who they are and how they integrated.  This is a kid and it gives opportunity to show the bullshit bias that I believe both sides can agree is wrong.  Are you a GAB rep and hellbent on the move or do you want to call them out and help this kid out?
0:::Enough with that retarded faggotration already.
0:::Just call them gay retards and be done with it. The left can only win if people stop communicating - which seems to be their goal. They want a monopoly on communication since they control the news stations.
1:::**Update:** He's back...  > I‚Äôm back.   > I look forward to hearing from Twitter as to why my account was suspended following my defense of Laura Loomer.   > The Left fears those they can‚Äôt control. The Left will NEVER control me.  https://twitter.com/thecjpearson/status/1068308767207550976  ---  **Update 2**: Twitter's explanation...  > Our systems automatically locked CJ Pearson's account in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). As soon as we were alerted to the error, we reactivated it. It will take a couple of hours for the follower count to return to normal.  https://mobile.twitter.com/TwitterComms/status/1068329104292798465
1:::Twitter is run by a bunch of bullies.
1:::But 16>12 ü§î
1:::All about silencing dissent against the rootless cosmopolitan globalist agenda
1:::Jesus I hope Clarence Tomas gets the case on this. 
1:::He‚Äôs back
1:::That‚Äôs a grown ass 13 year old
1:::DOJ needs to raid twitter for cp
1:::What about those parents that create accounts for their babies? Do they retroactively ban the baby when it comes out as conservative? 
1:::But 8 year olds can get their dicks chopped off.
1:::Kyle ka
1:::He lost all his Twitter followers. A "happy accident" from Twitter I'm sure.
1:::They banned a verified account? They verified it, then banned him because he... got too much traction.   
1:::It's okay to be black .... .... as long as you think the correct black thoughts.
1:::Wow.
1:::All I can say is lol
1:::Just added him to my Twitter feed. Everytime Twitter does this, it just backfires. They're not sending their best. 
1:::[Leftist are spreading lies claiming that he deleted his account while Twitter comms actually said they locked CJ](https://twitter.com/TwitterComms/status/1068329104292798465?s=19)  These leftists are so brainwashed its kinda sad and scary.  BTW, I started following CJ just because of this. 
1:::This is the "conservative" who backed Bernie Sanders in the 2016 election.
1:::These blatantly obvious acts show how much we are WINNING! Keep it up folks; God Bless America!
1:::By liberal logic Twitter is now racist and a Nazi white supremacist.
1:::President Trump should invite this based kid to the White House!
1:::He should stay off twitter before it brainwashes him too. The only things worth going to twitter for are Trump's tweets.
1:::It's amazing that these accidental lockouts only affect right of center people.  Almost amazing that out of 14 close congressional races this year where ballots were found they all ended up benefiting the Democratic candidatw.
1:::>In February 2015, Pearson received international media attention which led him to embark in his career in politics and journalism, after he created a YouTube channel on February 21, 2015, and two days later posted a video, "President Obama: Do you really love America?" in which he defended former mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani about the comments Giuliani had made criticizing former President Barack Obama.[9] Pearson also criticized Obama, saying, "If you really did love America, you would call (Islamic State) what it really is: an assault on Christianity, an assault on America and downright hate for the American values that our country holds‚Äîfreedom of speech, freedom of religion and every single thing that our country stands for".[9]   This kid is goin places 
1:::What do you call it when people are literally exactly what they accuse everyone else of?
1:::Protection racket, do what they say and your account won't have any "problems".
1:::Why do leftists always have to Ban political views instead of debating the political views!?
1:::Why did he lose 90k followers?
1:::This happened a while back. He‚Äôs had his twitter back for a while now.   Edit: unless it happened again. 
1:::Why the fuck is anyone still using Twitter?   If everyone from the center right quit using Twitter tomorrow in 6 months there would be a replacement and Jack would be fucking fired. 
1:::Didn't you read the terms of use for twitter? section 3 sub section 5 "if you are a conservative, we reserve the right to trample on your freedom to express yourself because you are a racist, homophobic bigot who deserves to be curb stomped"
1:::I thought it was ‚ÄúBLUE CHECK GOOD, ORANGE MAN BAD‚Äù. 
1:::Twitter is disgusting
1:::I just don't understand this i guess. You can't even say this happened by accident.  A computer can do simple math so that leaves a person... a person that wants to troll a kid because of his political beliefs.    What a small person they must be. 
1:::#LiberalArithmatic
1:::f nazi twitter
1:::I'm SICK of this oppression!!!!
1:::I love this kid, have always tried to keep up with his content. Another nuisance to the double-standard platform I see.
1:::"HS Junior" who is under 13? They must thing you are some kind of genius then. That four or five grades you skipped.
1:::I've heard this reason on a few occasions, all of the accounts were created before they were 13, and since he joined in 2014 he may have been too young when opening his account.  So I don't think this is so much of a partisan issue but more of Twitter is dumb issue.
1:::WOW... this has to be a record   Twitter, Facebook, Google, Amazon... we need massive regulation to stop these commie clowns
1:::That blue-check nobody William LeGate is all over saying that Pearson deleted his own account. How exactly, is LeGate relevant? He's a total fag.
1:::Websites have glitches all the time..
1:::Hey black people can be white supremacists now haven‚Äôt you heard?
1:::I absolutely cannot believe this nonsense is happening.  Poor CJ.    Go on CJ and your insightful self.  Never let them silence you.  xo
1:::Well people on the left and sometimes the right as well equate nationalism with supremacy and a 2 minute google search will tell you they are not the same thing.  But the left wants desperately to make the two things into the same because it fuels there narrative. And anyone who loves there country and is white is a racist. But anyone can be a nationalist regardless of ethnicity.
1:::And they banned it more than four years after it was created. "Better late than never" can only go so far. I wonder whether it takes them that long to ban actual <13 year olds.
1:::Why can't I upvote you more than once??? Because I'm reeeeeeeeeeeee?
1:::Makes you wonder how many conservative accounts got banned, but didn't have enough followers or YouTube subs to get reinstated.
1:::Love seeing that Arrow of Light in the background behind him.  Dude was a Cub Scout.  Highest honer of the Webelos!
1:::Love that he has his Arrow of Light in the background of the video. Dude was a proud Cub Scout. 
1:::I'm so glad they banned my MAGA account. I'll never go back. 
1:::Can‚Äôt have any wrongthink now can we? The left is doing what the left does best - suppress any one who goes against their narrative.
1:::Only reason im still on twitter is because my president uses twitter
1:::What year is it?!?!?!?!
1:::He was 14 then. Give him some time 
1:::To be fair, this isn‚Äôt necessarily Twitter alone being assholes. GDPR regulations made them ban a ton of accounts that were made before the users turned 13. 
1:::Fuck I feel old. 
1:::Nothing to see here. Just a system glitch
1:::He can just identify as a 35 year old 
1:::I had a tweet banned and my account suspended for a tweet that I had not tweeted yet. I was in the middle of editing it and my screen flashed over and the message had my tweet (again, I had not sent it yet) had been banned and my account suspended for hate post or some such.  Oddly enough, I was going to tweet in defense of Bill Maher and free speech.    The weird part is that I looked at my screen when I was editing the tweet- and it was 2:20 pm- the message with my banned tweet said I sent it at 2:16 pm.  You cannot edit a tweet that has already been sent.  Weird all they way around-  I contacted twitter via email and told them that the tweet had not been sent and the context of it was a quote from Bill Maher (when he made the "House Nigger" joke on Real-time).  My tweet was banned because of the use of the N-word-  I informed them that I am black and I don't want or appreciate people being offended on my behalf- there are a lot more ills in the black community than a fucking word- I also told them that it is a little odd that white people are now telling black dudes when and where they can say "nigger."  My account was taken off suspension at around 11 pm and my tweet was posted. 
1:::The only reason I ever considered getting a twitter was when your president started using it to circumvent the media, but then I realized every tweet will be posted here anyway so I didn't make one.   It's literally a shithole forum. 
1:::Are they simply identifying as another color? Who am I to judge.
1:::Be proud. Conservative Lives Matter
1:::Well done.
1:::Wait did they switch back to only a scale of 1600? I took it 5 years ago and it was on the scale of 2400
1:::This sounds like a dream I'd like to have.
1:::Block and mute are your best friend. It‚Äôs way better then Twatter. 
1:::So the rule is a outright ban despite it being 4 years later & verification done?  Was a age check not done during the verification? All that side you think the ban is justified? Are you seriously taking Twitter's side here? Idiot.
1:::Was going for leftists but I'll accept it.
1:::Hmm, funny, the GDPR sweep program missed his account. (And everyone else who's not a conservative voice)
1:::If you diddled children, you'd prolly get a pass from twatter on the lack of cuckery.
1:::you making this sub look bad, no i'm not taking twitter's side.  >They literally banned him because they thought he was 13.  not true, so i say it
1:::Well, that‚Äôs kind of tricky. Twitter operates in the EU, so they have to follow their regulations on things like releasing information they have on users upon request, for example. As such, some of these other policies probably just get handed out to everyone too. It‚Äôs weird, and shouldn‚Äôt be a thing, but he isn‚Äôt the only one in nor outside the EU to get his account suspended for this.   Now, I also will say that I have not heard of this happening recently. I heard a lot of people getting this a month ago, but not now. So yea, it could be some fuckery, but it could also just be shitty European regulations being implemented in a really shitty way that affects not only Europeans but everyone else too (fuck Europe). 
1:::If you do business in Germany you have to implement it.   Twitter can implement it or basically get fined. 
1:::Read "Hashtag" as "pound".  Have fun on twitter.
1:::Ese es rapisto!
1:::Didn‚Äôt say they did. 
1:::If that's the case, conservatives, constitutionalists, small-government/individual liberty advocates, straight white men,  (regardless of politics), and anyone else that is for traditional values instead of the Social Media values of censored speech, open borders, and the all cultures are equal should be scared for their future and the future of their descendants.  Social Media companies hate everything we stand for. We are choosing to share pictures of our families, our whereabouts, our likes and dislikes, our views, intimate information about loved ones and so much more of our private information- for free. We are just giving them data to sell; Then, they turn around and spend their money to fight us.  I respect folks choice to continue to use it. I'm pro-choice, you could say... lol. I just make my choice to stay off it. 
1:::I'd give you reddit gold, but fuck reddit.
1:::That's retarded
1:::The solution is to destroy the platform.  Step 1, remove 50% of their userbase.
1:::ogm what??? virtue signalling? shaking my smh i was just correcting something wrong you said. i don't like twitter. i did not deny they censor people on the right. how do you get all this from me correcting you. i don't even know what virtue signalling means
1:::an odd way of looking at it but you're not entirely wrong.
1:::Don't say gay.  That word is racist. 
1:::Where then? I'm in.
1:::You sound stupid.... grow up.
1:::Stop hoppin' around like a bunch of Kansas City faggots.
1:::Reeeeeeetarded 
1:::How about "chromosomally challenged"? 
1:::I think most people are unaware or forget that the words "lame" and "dumb" once described a disability too, but the current colloquial meanings are very different. It's usually considered okay to say something is "dumb," but the word means someone who is unable to speak, usually because he is deaf (like deaf, dumb, and blind). It's fine to describe a situation as "lame," but that word means a person who is unable to walk.  Come to think of it, we use the word "blind" in the same derogatory way that we use "retard." "Are you blind?" is acceptable, but "are you retarded?" is now highly offensive, even though both are interchangeable and refer to disabled people.  It just seems like such a strange hill for pro-political correctness people to die on. What point are they trying to prove exactly?
1:::i don't care how i sound, you made a paragraph to reply to a fact about this. that's amazing
1:::If you're retarded, your awareness is such that you won't find the word retarded "offensive". So I think the whole argument is retarded.
2:::Are they going to can little crybaby Jimmy Acosta too for this?
2:::That is racist
2:::This is harassment.   
2:::OK, folks, shut it down.  Time to be gone from Twitter.  The company will die, just like FB is dying and young people make fun of it and people that use it.
2:::NO NO NO hell now.  This kid has been legit for a while.  WTF.  Now, this is the shutdown??
2:::if you want to ban people for different views, don't claim to be an open place for everyone to express their ideas, views, and thoughts...because that is what a "public square" is and that is what they have claimed to be  &#x200B;
2:::GIT BACK ON THE PLANTATION, BOIIII!
2:::The TWATS at Twitter don't like their slaves leaving the plantation especially when they are young and and smart!
2:::The left is racist
2:::It may be time for litigation
2:::TIL HS juniors are under 13. Good god. Either they're blatantly discriminating against conservatives or they're too stupid to be trusted to run a company that holds private information if they're THAT easily duped/misled. Stupid or malicious (aka liar). There's no option three.
2:::So today at twitter, we banned a black kid in high school and have a jewish person protesting at our door.  
2:::meet the first person ever to be banned from social media for being under the age limit these websites put in. Congrats twitter you are not even hiding it anymore. 
2:::They just got him a bunch of followers and made him more popular lol. Well played Twitter 
2:::Twitter has gotten out of hand, I to was suspended because I had congratulated Kanye West on standing up for his free speech next thing you know ‚Äú your account has been suspended‚Äù.I am on Reddit now much better.
2:::the left hates nothing more than a minority person that thinks free.  It's sad because Latinos and African Americans deep down are conservatives in their way of life.  They are religious, family oriented and victims of violent crimes in the inner cities and want law and order.      They only vote democratic because they've been conditioned after several decades. 
2:::I assume he was banned because the account was created when he was under the age of 13? Guy that works at Roosterteeth was running a twitter for his kid and she went on after she was 13 and changed her DOB and they banned her for having an account before she was 13.  Or they just banned him because you can't have black conservatives talking on your website. Hard to tell now a days which one is true. 
2:::Notice how many of the news stories are labeling Laura Loomer as "far-right"
2:::To be fair, this isn‚Äôt limited to him. They banned a lot of people who made their accounts before they turned 13, due to new GDPR regulations. It‚Äôs usually as simple as sending in a parent‚Äôs ID to verify that they had parental permission. Whether or not this is the case here I don‚Äôt know, but this is probably the most likely reason. 
2:::I will say in twitter's defense they don't care if you're white or black or whatever. If you are not ultra liberal, you're going to get banned.  Except for Trump who they need. I so wish Trump would quit twitter so the stock would tank overnight. 
2:::Leftism or Progressivism
2:::I quit them, they are total bastards i only wish Trump would abandon it so they would suffer financially. 
2:::I mean... for lazy people, maybe. I still think the best place to be is in front of people - human interaction. Social media is a cesspool of click bait, people making $7600/ week driving a range rover, and ignorant people so convinced that *they* are right and that the half-assed fake news article they shared proves without a doubt how wrong everyone else is.  The best way to win people over is through real life interaction.
2:::GDPR isn't supposed to effect non-europoors though?
2:::Absolutely.  Its not a bug; its a feature.
2:::I'm guessing the algorithim is named Goebbels
2:::Gab does not ban leftist accounts.
2:::I never said they weren‚Äôt.
2:::How about an organized attack on Twitter????
2:::False, you're making this sub look bad with your virtue signaling. Gab is irrelevant in the space of the internet and is a fringe platform. Twitter is relevant in the space of the internet but is a  far-leftist platform that censors and targets people on the right unfairly. Denying that makes you look foolish. Unfortunately Gab will never gain seriousness as a platform partly because it is inferior to Twitter in capacity and features. Gab also harbors some of the most detestable people on the internet (actual Neo-Nazi supporters). Twitter is equally as bad in the people it protects such as, avowed Anti-Semites like Farrakhan and people that are free to say the most horrific things about Trump and his supporters. There is no "perfect" platform and I doubt their ever will be.  Twitter is bad, Gab is meh and pretty bad... there is no good platform. Unplug from them don't take any of them seriously as a platform. I do not make this sub look bad and you just lazily trying to say that about me says you know absolutely nothing about me.
2:::So if I identify as a Democrat-ale but post Pro-Trump stuff nonstop, they have to call me a Democrat-ale or they get banned? Or is this applying to only the 2 genders that exist?
2:::Yes, this.  We probably can't discuss it here, but yes.
2:::Not to say a normal person would receive the same treatment..
2:::My goal is to leverage the intelligence of this kid and give him the best reach possible to influence.  It's hard to change minds in separated echo chambers (Twitter & Gab).  He needs to be heard by kids his age.
2:::So buy him a radio slot on local AM radio.  You know, sometimes it's better to do something little that to do nothing at all.
3:::Can we get a message going that we want trump to start a nationalist party to replace the republican  and get rid of all the corporate shills? Republican politicians currently are for immigrations of low wages workers and not wanting to regulate these companies ruining our society. Nationalist party that‚Äôs focuses on family and our culture first over money and corporations. This free market capitalist republican party we have is ruining the country
3:::Heard someone say social media is way more far right than left, first time I ever thought my head would explode. 
3:::I think they have 1,000 monkeys at typewriters.  Seriously though, it has been obvious a long time to me they have a crew of people 'policing' and banning and when you get enough irrational blue-haired land whales with that power, stupid inconsistent shit is going to happen.  
3:::is laura still cuffed to the door?
3:::**UPDATE: https://twitter.com/thecjpearson/status/1068308767207550976**  CJ: "I‚Äôm back. I look forward to hearing from Twitter as to why my account was suspended following my defense of Laura Loomer. The Left fears those they can‚Äôt control. The Left will NEVER control me."
3:::Get. Off. Of. Social. Media.
3:::Well 3/5 of 16 is 9.6 so technically Twitter has a point.
3:::OK so let's say I decide today that I'm an apache helicopter. Will Twitter ban anyone who called me a guy yesterday? 
3:::I go to school with CJ 
3:::CJ and I used to be mutuals on twitter during the election bro switched sides to Bernie after some trump controversy and came back to trump post election maybe he did grow and is a real conservative but he could be just using conservatives too 
3:::What the actual fuck dude, WHAT THE HELL is with that bullshit? Fucking ridiculous lmao wtf.
3:::We keep seeing all these "oops" moments with banning on these platforms. I think they are hiring weirdo leftists into moderator positions and they are just brazenly going through and eliminating people they don't like. Then the issue is elevated to support, and remedied. Perhaps Twitter and Facebook do have some standards of impartiality (only some, because I'm not naive) but  these decisions are ultimately left up to individuals, and individual leftists sure do seem to lack the fuck out of some principles. 
3:::Imagine the weirdness of feeling like you are legit in an oppressed race of people, and yet both major sides of a political fight are warring for your favor.  I dunno, but all the libertarian/rightwing black people in my life are a far more elevated and uh, "woke" group than most. I really want this faction to grow. I go shooting with a group of law enforcement-affiliated black dudes that I about want representing everything about the future of America. Nerdy, kind, militant, fair, godly, successful, and gun-trained to a ridiculous and scary extent. And a good bit of them look like "average hood black dude" with baggy pants, dreads, tats, etc. And will earbeat the fuck out of you on AR trigger systems, optics, Jesus, America, the Constitution, family, and where the best BBQ is. Fucking love those guys.
3:::"Won't someone help me with this troublesome teenager?" - @Jack
3:::This is pretty dumb guys. There is no monopoly in social media. End users or consumers have 100% the choice to use whatever platform they want. 
3:::no, at the time of account creation he was not 13
3:::Well they do write the algorithms don‚Äôt they?  They‚Äôre always blaming the code that they wrote, yet it primarily only affects one political demographic.  
3:::Our guy!
3:::Yeah I‚Äôm not suggesting staying on Twatter AT ALL. 
3:::Black men voted over 95% for Obama, but something like 75% for Clinton. Huge difference.   It was the biggest change of any demographic, but MSM ignores that and tells us it was white woman who voted 53% Obama 47% Clinton.   People like you are the biggest reason Trump is our president, but we're not allowed to admit this. Thanks for thinking for yourself!
3:::Ok but the solution isn‚Äôt to abandon a platform to use another one with less exposure. You have to fight it somehow.
3:::Tru dat
3:::1) Fuck you, I represent me, so thanks for the low-life slander attack worthy of a Democrat.  2) Gab is the only alternative, now.  3) "Call them out", geezuz, are you like 12?  They have no shame, there is no "calling out". That course of action is a complete waste of time and calories.  &#x200B;
3:::Its fundamentally pointless because the word only has that negative meaning because people inherently consider mental disabilities negative. So all such contortions end up doing is create a new word that will be used to describe a negative trait, which will eventually end up being as "offensive" as retard. 
3:::It is that and more. It's the purest form of censorship. If you control the language you control the rules by which life is lived. It's the ultimate cheat code.  The Left thrives by punishing their enemies. They are merciless, utterly merciless. But at the same time they fear us terribly. They fear the words of this boy because he speaks the truth, and the truth is like holy water to them. 
4:::It's not a joke... this is real.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BqyB2SgBkKD/  They literally banned him because they thought he was 13.
4:::N   Rn
4:::This the the 2nd time actually for the same reason. They're just fucking with us  
4:::Went to gab in 2017. Twatter is cancer 
4:::You mean the same people that push in media and advertising to "be yourself" are responsible for the majority of today's conformity??  Let me check CNN  Yup, we have always been at war with eastasia! 
4:::social media is where elections are fought now. 
4:::There are leftists on Gab.AI its not an Echo Chamber.  They dont ban for politics. 
5:::This is censorship out and out. CJ is 16, he has had videos out there for awhile, he's a bright articulate young man and that is what the opposition fears the most, a younger generation which doesn't fall into the NPC category.
5:::The slave masters are so scared, why else would they be so anxious to put black people back in line. Blexit is happening!!
5:::They're looking to ban as many conservative voices as possible to mitigate this new story from BuzzFeed. My guess is this story isn't as solid as they would like it to be. I read a bit, but it seemed all over the place and went off on a tangent. Anonymous sources of course.   But with fewer conservative voices online, they're fewer people to call this article out. 
5:::Can't do it. I don't let other men bang my wife.
5:::THATS RAYSISS
5:::HEEEEEEEE cough cough REEEEEEEEEE. 
5:::It's just a matter, look no further. 
5:::True. But Twitter is retarded. 
5:::What was? "I dont recall."
5:::informacionguerras.comera
5:::Make America Galactic Again.
6:::Intentional, faggot soy Twitter employees confirmed. God I hate these people. 
6:::Completely fucking insane.  Twitter must reinstate CJ Pearson and Laura Loomer tonight if they want to save any face.
6:::CJ Was born in 2002, which makes him 16 right now. This is censorship. Fuck twitter. 
6:::Fuckberg is a cuck, Jack dorsey is a cuck, Spez is a bigot, social medial is fucking cancer. Don't worry I didn't forget google, FUCK YOU  Too!!! 
6:::You guys act like the Democrat party has been trying to silence Black people since they brought them here for slavery.  
6:::Go to gab. 
6:::Isn't the Supreme Court looking into conservatives being banned on sites like Twitter and Facebook? 
6:::Infiltrate Twitter. Pretend to be leftists and get jobs there
6:::Did I hear the aut'''tic batsignal? This is how to get Tech censorship (of Conservatives or any) stopped:  1. These corporations are engaging in interference with US Citizens and the electoral, election, and political process. 2. These corporations hire foreign nationals. 3. **Nowhere in the US Constitution** does it give the FEDERAL GOV the power to allow foreign nationals to interfere with US Citizens and the American election (political) process. 4. These Companies shall either cease their activities of censorship on US Citizens; or be required to divest all their foreign nationals from employment or contract, or third party contracts or agreements for the same (Founders included).  Long Live Our Free REPUBLIC!!  \-Quaker Pede  Let our PRES know, **No Congress money is needed** to build The Real Wall, just go around the corner to WIFIA at EPA and Drain the Swamp to uncover it being hidden and $11 billion diverted from funding it.  [https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/)
6:::They don't care how obvious it is because they never face any consequences. The hashtag MeToo thing bit them in the ass because they are a bunch of sexual freaks, but generally they don't give a fuck if you know they are manipulating everything. I'm sure they get off on it, really. Power mad, the whole lot of them.
6:::Well, there's dumbasses and retards. Retards have a legitimate excuse for being faggots.
7:::Just quit Twitter over this.  Gab from now on.
7:::Twitter is pure evil fuckery and it's waking everyone up to hate on them.  
7::: I say that we all just completely leave their platform.  Let them have the liberal echo chamber utopia they think they want.  
7:::It's a loophole.
7:::‚ÄúTwitter is on CP time‚Äù -Shillary
8:::Good. He might as well learn now just how unable we are to protect our own.  &#x200B;  He's got a lifetime of disappointment .... 
8:::Please DJt invite this kid to your office! Make a giant showing and force the media to give attention to this incident! 
8:::I only use twitter for my runescape account and trump tweets. Having an established presence there is the only way for an in game ban appeal or account recovery to work. On the plus side the memes and devs are good.  I just couldn't imagine using it for any irl purpose without selling shit.
8:::Who cares if we create a conservative echo chamber, if we starve Twitter of conservative  content(tweets) you kill half their user base. It's a first step to find a replacement to Twitter.  The_donald is a echo chamber if you didn't notice and are doing fine policing our own, the left does not police their own.
8:::I know it seems that way but a streamlined interface is a matter of life and death in today's mobile-dominated tech world.
8:::I still don't understand why that word in particular is so taboo. It's certainly derogatory, but it's an actual way to say someone has slowed development. Are people just supposed to say disabled or slow? "En retard" in French literally means late, so why do English speakers have such a fit over the word? 
8:::We need a galactic wall, and the damn reptillians need to pay for it!
9:::This is unprecedented even for twitter. Is anyone tweeting about this? It should be bigger than Jesse Kelly.
9:::I know this is a great platform to voice stupid liberal opinions for liberal losers  with abandon  but at what point do we shut the fucker down? Why do do we and the GEOTUS  use this cesspool?  I'm getting tired of conservative voices being shutdown . Hit them where it hurts, in their wallets. 
9:::Some might say, "grossly negligent."
9:::Fucking Twitter sure thinks one account is a threat to their Groupthink.
9:::It looks like he did anyway, his account is now following 0 and has around 3000 followers. One of his tweets said he came back to only 400 followers.
9:::It's another example of their desire to change language into the way they see fit. This gives them more opportunities to call normal people out for "oppression" and perpetuates the victimhood machine. I wouldn't be surprised if words like idiot or asshole are banned because they *may* be offensive to a very small subset of people. It's a slippery slope that will erode our language until it's unrecognizable. 
10:::He must have joined PewDiePie's 9 year-old army. A clever loophole.
10:::What can I do to help the downfall of Twitter?!
10:::> My parents are immigrants from a communist regime, and they've told me that this type of shit is something straight out of the communist propaganda playbook in deception and oppression of the population. This is classic, "illegal, but technically legal" totalitarian propaganda, that has been used by virtually all communist regimes over the past century, and that it is starting to be employed ever more frequently by the left and mainstream media.   Chilling.
10:::Yes, and Twitter has nothing to fear, because progressives couldn't muster a moment of self-reflection or logical thinking if you held a knife to one of their double chins.
11:::Now he is back however they reset his followers... They don't even give a shit who knows now; they are straight trolling this kid.
11:::Twitter is kkk?
11:::Someone could make a name seeing precedents like this.
11:::I noticed you post in t_d. Nice try nazi. 
11:::They have a right to free speech too. 
11:::you just said HE...
11:::Which is hilarious because most of the time you are replying to someone you haven‚Äôt necessarily looked at their profile, so you might misgender them based on their image or what they say.
11:::Political correctness has ruined comedy and our society. 
12:::The left hates dissent.   **They hate disobedience**  #THEY HATE YOU, THEY LITERALLY WANT YOU DEAD AND SILENT
12:::Why did they verify him then?
12:::Okay. You have to be an idiot or you'll be in violation.  ...but something makes me think you'll be just fine. XD
13:::He got 1290. Kyle Kashuv got 1590.
13:::it is!  Because it only takes a moment of self reflection and logical thinking to realize how stupid progressive liberalism has become
14:::This is messed up.  That kid is sharp and has done well branding himself.  We should all fight back on this one.
14:::The Supreme Court doesn't "look into things". They rule on cases which come before them. 
14:::I just checked and Jaden Smith was less than 13-years-old when he joined Twitter. He was born in July 1998 in joined March 2011 that would‚Äôve made him 12 years old at the time.  So I assume they‚Äôre going to delete his account is well? 
14:::It's in the TOS. Says you are required to call someone the gender they currently identify as or banned. 
15:::Is he one of those geniuses that skipped four years of school?
15:::Fair enough, but a week ago they were under attack and didn't even have a site.  And I guess I'm not against people keeping their Twitter.  But they should ALSO go to gab.  Build the platform in the meantime.  
16:::Sounds like they fucked up by allowing the account before he was 13 in the first place. 
16:::Who cares. That's nothing compared to it being ran by leftist totalitarians.
16:::Twitter will own their "mistake" (correction: Their official policy) of silencing reason as soon as Hillary apologizes for a lifetime of lies and treason.  You still don't understand who these things in human suits really are, do you?
17:::  "The left's youngest nightmare" is right...  God bless this dude. 
17:::"Twitter ain't in no ways tired..."
17:::What gets me is the double standard. You can't use retard as an insult because it's offensive to people who are actually retarded. But then you can't call people who are actually retarded retards because somehow it's derogatory. Which is it? Is it insulting or is it the correct terminology for an actual thing? Or, like everything with the left, is it just whatever double standard they need to always be right?
18:::[deleted]
18:::I used Twitter for strictly business only purposes when I managed a very small studio. It helped a little, and I'm glad I didn't use it in any other capacity because it may have lowered my IQ some.
18:::Extremely careless. 
18:::I‚Äôm black and I got banned twice. They said I could unlock my account but blocked it from sending me he code. They hate black conservatives and he had a lot of influence. I know he is upset tonight and I‚Äôm sorry!
20:::Do more than that.  Congress and Senate probably have a hard time understanding tech issues so its our job to help educate why it MATTERS to us. Save the screenshoots and explain why the accounts are banned **according** to Twitter policy. Explain the Platform vs Publisher debate and why Tech companies can't be both.
23:::The dude was also losing followers by the boat loads in the purges 
25:::Since they gave the reason and it's based on a false premise, he should let them know he's 16. See what reason they come up with next. Twitter is racist.
26:::Can‚Äôt he just remake his account now that he‚Äôs 16?
26:::What's the new policy?
27:::Super predators are banned from Twitter
29:::Jack Dorsey is trying to play dumb. CJ is over 13. We patriots know the real reason why they banned CJ. They banned CJ because he is a Republican. I don't know who Jack thinks he is trying to fool.
29:::Guess which one of them will get their account back pronto.
29:::We can do Gab but he was banned for a wrong reason.  Twitter should own their mistake and be ripped a part by the media.
31:::And they wouldn't give him a blue check on his new account.
32:::UPDATE: https://twitter.com/thecjpearson/status/1068308767207550976  CJ: "I‚Äôm back. I look forward to hearing from Twitter as to why my account was suspended following my defense of Laura Loomer. The Left fears those they can‚Äôt control. The Left will NEVER control me."
36:::This is such bullshit. Fuck these fucking people. 
37:::#HIGH TECH LYNCHING
38:::Gab needs a UX overhaul, especially on mobile. 
39:::What the fuck? He lost almost all of his followers now, though.   These leftist motherfuckers are so fucking devious, it seriously pisses me tf off. I guarantee you that if confronted about it, these fucks will make some sort of bullshit excuse along the lines of: "oops sorry for accidentally banning you, there was a mistake in our oversight process, however, because your account was temporarily, permanently banned, there was a glitch in our servers because the system thought your account was deleted, which automatically unfollowed you from all of your followers. We have attempted to recover as many as we could, but we could only get a fraction of them back. We apologize for any inconvenience." We all know damn well that Twitter could give him *all* of his followers back with a press of a button if they wanted to, but will probably play dumb and won't because the objective all along was to silence him and take away his voice. Whether that is done by banning him outright or deleting all of his followers, the results are the same.  My parents are immigrants from a communist regime, and they've told me that this type of shit is something straight out of the communist propaganda playbook in deception and oppression of the population. This is classic, "illegal, but technically legal" totalitarian propaganda, that has been used by virtually all communist regimes over the past century, and that it is starting to be employed ever more frequently by the left and mainstream media. We need to stay vigilant and keep our eyes open to this bullshit.  The average leftist sjw may be borderline retarded, but make no mistake that the leftists in positions of power in the government and media platforms throughout the country are extremely clever and devious, and know exactly what the fuck they're doing when they do this shit. Don't fall victim to it.
43:::GAB.IO
44:::That‚Äôs faggety retarded shit
45:::The point being if he made a new account, he would lose all the followers he currently has.
48:::I hate twitter. Seriously, I hate it. Even when I considered myself left-leaning, I never used it, never understood it (probably part of why I didn‚Äôt use it), and never read anything on it. But that being said, I just heard about this happening to the daughter of a left-leaning public figure 3 days ago. They were complaining about how stupid it was that she announced she‚Äôd just turned 13, so twitter shut down her account because it meant she‚Äôd created her account before she was 13. 
48:::But then you have two echo chambers. One on the left, and one on the right. I don‚Äôt know, but I doubt, that Twitter accounts change all that many minds. Who knows though. According to the left $300,000 of advertising on Facebook completely changed the outcome of the election. 
49:::To be honest, if you're a lawyer looking for a test case this is the one right here.......
53:::Oh, the left has a _special_ hatred of minority conservatives...
60:::Don't say retarded. That word is gay.
65:::How about 50,000 pedes follow him on GAB?
84:::Go to gab.  Abandon twitter. They hate you.
87:::I‚Äôve had it with these 12 year old high school juniors and their Twitter accounts!
88:::"You have violated Twitters terms of use.  Twitter will now burn a cross in your front yard, you uppity Negro."
96:::You have to be retarded or you'll be in violation.
102:::Yeah we need to help this kid fight this.  
104:::DJT AND Don Jr. - we know you lurk here! Break up the big tech monopoly!!! Build the wall and break up the Silicon Valley hive of villainy 
124:::Not surprising at all. It's right a long the same reasoning they used to ban people who violated their new trans policy, for statements made before the policy took effect. 
128:::Twitter is on a conservative banning frenzy lately. What are people gonna do about it?
192:::A young black conservative that just scored 1590(!) on his SATs.    
259:::Twitter: "get back to your plantation, boy."
404:::oh they're trying....  if CJP was born in 2002 and created an account in 2014... he was 12 at the time.  Its absolute garbage logic for them to pull,  but what do you expect from swaths of people who are ok with justifying their thoughts with "you vote Red so your opinion doesn't matter".
406:::A young black conservative is basically the hydrogen bomb of the culture war.  He had to be stopped.
1390:::They just banned a VERIFIED account, that they verified, saying it doesn't meet requirements. LOL.  They're not even trying anymore to hide it.  No wonder they're targeting CJ, he's destoying the left's racist narrative... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrJva62NXKs
